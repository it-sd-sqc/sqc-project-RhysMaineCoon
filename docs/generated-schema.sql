('Chapter 1: “I HAVE EATEN OF THE FURNACE OF HADES”', 
'A very famous book in Japan is named the
“Ko-Ji-Ki,” and the word means “A Record
of Ancient Matters.” We thought on our second
morning as we walked through the hills that if
there should happen to be a modern chronologist
recording a present-time Ko-Ji-Ki those
hours of the sun’s approaching meridian would
be entered without dispute as The-Forever-Famous-Never-To-Be-Equalled-Day-Of-Fire.
In
the valleys there was no breeze; on the summits
there was no shade; and everywhere it seemed
probable that on the next instant the road would
blister into molten heat bubbles under our feet.
However—to anticipate—if such a postulated
chronicler had so styled that second day of our
walking as one without chance of peer among
historical days of heat, on the very next following
day he would have had to turn back to cross
out his lines. In the burning glare of the rice
fields, anything that had gone before was so[57]
easily surpassed that we forever lost belief in
maximums, unless indeed kinetic energy might
continue on such a wild rampage of vibration
that it would shake itself completely out of
existence.
Our first rest of the second day, as I said,
was devoted to the arithmetic of finance. At
that early hour the dew was not yet off the
grass, but when we began planning for another
rest the world had grown parched. Looking
about for some possible spot we saw through
the trees the roof of a small temple. We halted
at the entrance and tried to push open the gate.
It would not move. It was nailed to the ribs
of the fence, but the gate was low enough to be
vaulted. Our feet fell on the ghost of a path
that had once led to the shrine. Harsh brambles
and weeds had fought for the possession of the
path until they had almost conquered the flaggings.
If we thought at all we thought that
that particular walk must have been abandoned
for some other entrance and as the scratches
were not very serious we pushed our way through
until at last we stepped forth into the temple
yard. Not a sign of caretaking devotion was
anywhere in evidence nor was there a nodding
priest sitting in the temple door.
[58]
Sometimes the Chinese desert their temples
but, when incense is no longer burned before an
altar, celestial practical sense leaves little that is
movable behind. We slowly walked up the
steps to the door, expecting to find the temple
rifled. The door was sealed by spiders’ webs.
We then walked around the balcony and peered
through the wide cracks in the shogi. No fingers
of man had rummaged there since the priests
had said the last mass, but the fingers of decay
had been busily working. The rotted fabrics
hung down from the altars of the shrines and
the ashes of the incense in the bronze bowls was
hidden by the blacker dust which the wind had
carried through the shutters. Surely we were
the first intruders to step upon the balcony since
the gate had been swung to and nailed.
We walked around the corners until we had
seen everything that there was to see and then
we jumped down to a grassy slope on the shady
side of the temple and stretched ourselves out
in relaxation. It was very quiet. As I knew
O-Owre-san could sleep for ten minutes and
then wake up to the instant, I closed one eye
and then the other. They both came open together.
I had felt a soft dragging across my
ankles and I raised my head to see a very thin,[59]
long, green and grey snake raising its head up
between my feet to stare into my face. After
a beady inspection it wriggled away with slow
undulations into the grass. And then, from the
spot where that snake had taken passage over
my ankles, came the head of another. I jerked
my feet up under me.
The instant before there had been an oppressive
quietness. The silence had been so supreme that
we ourselves had scarcely spoken. Now there
was a vast hurrying of little noises. Lizards
ran along the rafters under the roof and dropped
down the wall, as lizards do, to flatten themselves
away into corners. Huge buzzing flies rose from
the surface of the pond and bumped against us
aimlessly. Mosquitoes came from the shadows.
I had thrown my helmet on the grass. I picked
it up to find it beset with ants. I tried to beat
them out of the lining by pounding the hat
against the side of the temple. The effort broke
loose a roach infested board.
We grinned at each other a little shamefacedly
when we were safely out into the sunshine of the
highroad. We had not stayed to argue in the
temple yard. As we stood thus vanquished and
ejected, two peasants came passing by. They
looked at us, then glanced hurriedly at the temple[60]
roof above the low trees, and then eyed us again.
They mumbled a word or two. Perhaps they
were trying to tell us that an accursed goblin
had stolen over their shrine to be the abode of
insects and crawling things. I was not so sure
that I had not seen the glowing eyes of a goblin
staring malevolently at us from the cracks of
the shogi when I turned to look back over my
shoulder as we fled.
For a long way my blood welcomed the sun.
The road led down into a broad valley to become
later little more than an interminable bridge
across the terraced paddy fields. The rice had
sprouted but had not grown rank enough to
block the mirror surface of the water from throwing
back the heat rays. Ahead were low-lying
hills with higher slopes beyond and from the map
we thought that over that barrier would be the
broad plain across which we would find the road
leading straight to Nagoya.
There was one ambition to luxury which we
always possessed—when we chose a rest spot we
wished one of comfort and, if it could be included,
also that it should have a view. Curiously,
owners of land do not seem to endeavour to
provide such rest places for sensitive travellers,
at least to be obtrusive at any exact second when[61]
desired. We had taken seven or eight miles
across the valley at an unusually accelerated pace
since our last attempt at a rest. Messages from
the cords of our legs were telling us to concede
some compromise to our particularity. However,
we continued walking and searching without paying
attention to the messages. The grass patches
always disclosed little ant hills upon close inspection
and the occasional heaps of stones to be
found were never under the shade. That obstinacy
of ours was of the stuff ambition should be,
and finally its persistency met due reward. We
found a wide, shady platform built against a
long building, half house, half granary. The
building flanked the road at a bend and as we
made the turn we could see the family of the
house lying on the floor. An old man was telling
an elaborate story and his listeners were so
intent upon the tale that none of them happened
to look up to see us. The platform was
out of their vision and we thought that we
might rest there with the comfortable feeling
that trespassing does not exist unless discovered.
The tale that was being told was undoubtedly
humorous. The daughters of the family were
hard struggling with laughter. The men were[62]
emphasizing their approval by pounding on the
rim of the charcoal brazier with their iron pipes.
All were repeating a continuous hei, hei. But
there was a baby, and the baby was not so much
interested in the story as he was in a butterfly.
He suddenly betook himself to his dimpled legs
and circled into the road in pursuit. The whims
of the gyrations of the mighty hunter carried
him to a spot where the next turn left him facing
two foreigners on the platform. He stood with
feet apart and carefully lifted the corner of his
diminutive shirt to his mouth for more careful
cogitation, as any Japanese child should and
does do when confronted by a kink in the well-ordered
running of affairs.
The mother called out an admonition but there
was no response from the akambo. She left the
story to find out what might be the enchantment.
She, too, began staring without responding to
admonitions. Another head bobbed around the
corner post and then another and another until
finally the teller of the tale himself forsook the
realm of fancy for fact and followed after his
audience. We said “O-hayo!”—which is good-morning—and
they said “O-hayo!” After that
their rigid attention included everything from
our hats to our boots. Then in a body they[63]
walked back into the house and were quiet except
for the most hushed of whispers.
“Two trespassing strangers are about to receive
some mark of respect,” said O-Owre-san.
“Respect of being told to move on, most
likely,” was my more worldly judgment.
“How about betting a foreign dinner to be
paid in Yokohama before the boat sails?” asked
O-Owre-san.
I took the wager, and lost.
The old man who had been the teller of the
story now reappeared. He was somewhat embarrassed
but at each step of his approach he
had a still broader smile. He was short and
he was thin, with lean, knotted muscles. His
limbs had grown clumsy from heavy toil.
His face was squat as if in his malleable infancy
some evil hand had pressed his forehead down
against his chin. One piece of cloth saved him
from nudity. He was a coolie of generations
of coolies, but despite his embarrassment and
despite his clumsy limbs, the very spirit of graciousness
created a certain grace as he placed
a tray before us. He backed away with low
bow succeeding low bow. The tray held a pot
of tea and two cups and some thin rice cakes.
Good man, he fortunately never knew what[64]
an argument his gift precipitated! My opponent
began it all by suggesting that we leave a
twenty sen silver piece on the tray. I disputed.
“A cup of tea is of such slight cost to the
giver,” was my eloquent and disputatious argument,
“that by being of no price it becomes
priceless and thus is a perfect symbol of a complete
gift in an imperfect world. Japan has this
tradition which we have lost in our own civilization.
This simplicity allows the poorest and
humblest to give a gift to the richest and
mightiest in the purity of hospitality. If we
leave money on the tray we are robbing the
peasant of his privilege.”
O-Owre-san would have none of my transcendentalism.
“By leaving money,” said he, “a sum
which means no more to us than does the cup
of tea to the peasant, we are making an exchange
of gifts. We know that he is very poor. Twenty
sen is probably more than the return for two
days of his labour. It will buy him a pair of
wooden geta or a new pipe, or a bamboo umbrella
for his wife, or such a toy for the baby as it
has never dreamed of. After giving our gift
we shall disappear down the road, leaving the
memory of two ugly but generous foreign devils.”
There was no dispute between us about wishing[65]
to leave some gift. The final compromise
was somewhat on my side as we gave a package
of chocolate to the child. We carried the chocolate
for emergency’s sake and it had cost several
times twenty sen. I do not believe that Japanese
children like chocolate and there was more than
a possibility that this highly condensed brand
would make the baby ill. Surely the deposed
gods of the ancient Tokaido must have made
merry if the news of our analytics was carried
to their Valhalla. Nevertheless our present,
wrapped in a square of white paper according
to the etiquette of gifts, was received by the
family with as many protestations of appreciation
as if we had handed them a deed to perpetual
prosperity.
The rays of the forenoon’s sun when we were
crossing the valley of the rice fields had sent up
heat waves from the dust of the road until the
road itself seemed to me to have a quaking pitch
and roll. We were now in the full glory of the
noontide. I was becoming somewhat disturbed
over certain phenomena. Trees and rocks and
houses fell into the dance of the heat waves with
an undignified stagger. Sometimes the bushy
trees reeled away in twos and threes where but
a moment before I had seen but one. The most[66]
disconcerting part of the development was my
peculiar impersonal interest and study of my
own distress. I knew that my eyes were aching
and I knew that the trees were really standing
still. I had the perfect duality of being fascinated
by the day and thus not wishing to be
any place else in the world and yet, as I said,
of being extremely disturbed by the preliminary
overtures of a sunstroke. We had had about
two hours of climbing since we left the house
of the rice farmer and we were on the summit
of the last high hills. Immediately ahead the
rocky path dropped sharply down into the plain.
A rest-house marked the point where the climbing
changed to the descent. I suggested a halt.
The rest-house was more than a peasant’s hut.
It was easy to believe that in more aristocratic
days it had been an inn of some pretension.
Now it was a spot for weary coolies to throw
down their heavy packs for a few minutes’ rest
in its shade by day or by night to curl up on
the worn mats. We walked into the deepest
recess of the entrance before we sat down. I
could look beyond a half-folded screen into the
kitchen. The polished copper pots and the iron
and bronze bowls were not of this generation;
probably to-morrow’s will find them on a museum[67]
shelf or cherished in some antique shop. However,
I had no desire to discover curios nor did
I have any preference whether the inn was old
or new, nor whether it had been its fortune to
entertain daimyos or pariahs. We first asked
for something to drink. The hostess dragged
up a bucket from the well and brought us bottles
of ramune which had been cooling in the depths.
I drank the carbonated stuff and then pushed
my rucksack back along the mat for a pillow
and closed my eyes for a half-hour’s blissful
forgetfulness. When I awoke the throbbing
under my eyelids had passed away and for the
first time I really looked at our hostess. She
was kneeling beside us and was slowly fanning
our faces.
Her teeth were painted black, as was once the
fashion for married women. She had known both
toil and poverty, but it was not a peasant’s face
into which I looked. Her thin fingers and
wasted forearms found repose in the lines which
the ancient artists were wont to copy from the
grace of Old Japan. Her calm face was
beautiful.
It was time that we should make our way
down the rocky path. She brought us tea before
we went. The bill for everything, as I[68]
remember, was about seven cents. We left a
silver coin beside the teapot. She began to tell
us that we had made a mistake. We told her no.
Shielded by an unworldly, intangible delicacy,
I doubt whether any rudeness of her guests ever
became sufficiently real to her to disturb her
passivity or her emotions, but such a guardianship
presents a thin callous against sympathy.
As we said good-bye a sudden sense of human
mutuality smote the three of us, an experience
of sheer bridging-over intuition which sometimes
comes for a second.
The absolute relaxation had so marvellously
driven out the devils from my eyes that I did
not even tell O-Owre-san of my hallucinations.
To make up for our lingering we pushed on
through the villages without stopping to wander
into temple grounds or to explore by-ways.
Between a misreckoning of miles on our part
and some misinformation which I gathered from
a peasant, we reached the rather large town of
Siki an hour earlier than we had hoped. As we
strolled through the main street, we saw several
inns which might well have given us comfortable
shelter, but I sensed that the traveller at my side
was waiting for some bubbling of inspiration.
I kept silent, an expiation for having carried[69]
a disproportionate number of points that day.
We continued walking. I could see the fringe
of the first rice field ahead. My faith was beginning
to waver but before I erred by showing it
O-Owre-san stopped abruptly and inquired the
Japanese word for inn. He then asked for one
or two other words and adjectives. Thus armed
he stepped into a shop, the appearance of which
had perhaps been the stimulus to his inspiration.
The shop had glass windows and a glass door.
It was the most metropolitan example of commercial
progressiveness which we had seen since
we left Kyoto. In fact, compared to the other
shops of Siki it had as haughty an exclusiveness
as any portal along New Bond Street seeks to
maintain over possible rivals. Looking through
the glass of the door we discovered that the floor
was not covered with matting. Such a last touch
of foreignism meant that one could walk in without
taking off one’s dusty boots. I do not remember
that we ever again found this detail of
Western culture outside the port cities. In the
heart of the most isolated mountain range the
most lonesome charcoal burner knows three
things about the foreigner: that he is hairy like
the red fox; that he has a curious and barbarous[70]
custom known as kissing; that his boots are part
of his feet.
Into this shop, then, O-Owre-san walked without
having to undo his bootlaces. There was
also an aristocratic glass counter and under the
glass, in show trays, were gold watches. Behind
this counter sat a young man in a kimono of black
silk. His face was pale, ascetic, and contemplative.
He smiled and bowed in formal hospitality.
The grace of such a bow comes from centuries
of saying yes instead of no. A cultured Japanese,
almost any Japanese, never flatly contradicts
unless to deny another’s self-derogatory statement.
The iiye (used as “no”) is rarely heard
and the carrying over of the omnibus hei, hei, or
the more polite sayo, into the English yes often
brings consternation to the Westerner seeking
accurate information.
O-Owre-san said, “Please, good inn” (directly
translated). As if the pale and ascetic seller
of gold watches was accustomed daily to having
perspiring foreigners with packs on their backs
inquire for this information, he bowed again and
smiled and said, “Hei, hei!” This time the hei,
hei did mean yes. He drew his kimono tighter
about his hips and adjusted his silken obi, and
walked out of the shop with us. Apologizing[71]
for the necessity of going before, he piloted us
through turns of the street to the gateway of
an inn. Calling for the mistress he made a
dignified oration of introduction, and backed
away from our sight with innumerable appreciations
for the honour of being asked to be of
service.'),
('Chapter 2: THE IDEALS OF A SAMURAI', 'In the morning we found great brass basins of
water waiting for us in the sunny iris garden.
One of the super-errors that a foreigner can make
in a native inn is to ask to have the basins
brought to his room. Such a request can be understood
only as a perversion, or a barbarity.
One reason why the houses and inns seem so
clean is that they eliminate so many of the chances
for their being otherwise; and this defence might
be added into the weighing when criticizing Japanese
nudity at ablutions.
Breakfast was brought to us steaming under
the lacquer covers of the bowls, but the priest’s
daughter was not holding the wooden ladle for
the rice. It was a rather late hour when she had
returned to her father’s house, but the mothers
and daughters of a Japanese home are accustomed
to having their working hours overlap into the
night. In subtlety we brazenly accused each other
of having frightened the gentle ne-san into not
returning. The truth was—as it afterwards came[158]
out—that we had each found opportunity to hint
to the host’s ear the night before that the maid’s
slumber by no means should be disturbed for our
morning’s start. Thus we each privately thought
we knew the secret of her non-appearance, but
just as we were tying on our shoes at the door a
breathless message was brought by her small
brother. She had overslept. It had not been
our late hour which was responsible. The family
of the Shinto priest had sat up almost until the
first light in the East to listen to the wonder
tale of their daughter who had endured such a
singular and daring adventure.
The ancient host gave us presents and we gave
him presents. We said our farewells at the door
and then, after that, he and his granddaughter
walked along with us half through the village.
Finally we bowed our formal seven bows of farewell.
When we reached the end of the street
we turned and saw them still standing where we
had left them.
The road led across a wide, flat valley. That
morning there was a truly extraordinary phenomenon.
The claret red of the sun flamed and
danced against the snows of the mountain wall
at our left. Finally our road broke up into a
delta of small paths. The soft earth had been[159]
so cut into ruts by heavy carts that Hori was
forced to accede to the demands of the bicycle
that it should be assisted and not ridden, but he
did not surrender until the wheel had demonstrated
its malevolence by pitching him a half-dozen
times off the saddle. Thus we all walked
along together. The villages were rather mean,
with the air of having come down in the world.
Some of the towns, in the days before machinery,
had had special fame in the various handicrafts;
one had been known for its hand-made wooden
combs. Evidently there remain some conservatives
who have not yet countenanced modern vulcanite
innovations, as wooden combs were still
being made for sale. Entire families, from grandparents
to children, were the manufacturers, the
factories their own homes. We bought a boxful
for a few sen. In arriving at a selling price
they must have valued their time in the manufacturing
as a gratuitous contribution to the
arts.
Every once in a while O-Owre-san and I had
had our pleasure in drawing the long bow of our
imagination concerning the architectural reason
for a certain peculiar type of house. A recurring
example is to be found in nearly every village.
These buildings are unusually substantial and[160]
the windows are always heavily barred and shuttered.
They give a suggestion of descent from
the castles of feudal days. As I said, we had employed
our elaborate imagining over the mysterious
buildings, but our guesses had never
brought us anywhere near to the truth. Hori
explained that they are the houses of the pawnbrokers.
Hori is the son of a samurai. (He has
the right to wear, if he wishes, the full number
of crests on his formal kimono.) The artists who
made the old colour prints used to give to the
eyes of the two-sworded samurai an expression
of warlike ferocity. When Hori spoke of the
pawnbrokers his eyes glared, and I was sure that
I detected his hand starting to reach for the
sword that has now gone from his girdle. However,
the ubiquitous bicycle just then swung
around and entangled him, as a reminder, probably,
that this is a new age, a mechanical and not
a feudal one, and that a samurai no longer has the
general and hearty acquiescence of law and society
to proceed to direct action against the loathed
money lender. The law of the land says to-day
that the pawnbroker must be considered as a free
and equal citizen, enjoying full rights under the
mercy of the Mikado; albeit (as the bars and shutters
of his windows show), the money lender still[161]
wisely believes in keeping his powder dry even in
an age of enlightenment.
When we had extricated Hori from the bicycle
and we had all got going again, he explained
why the pawnbroker is the most hated member of
Nipponese society. Here are some of the other
remarks that Hori made about pawnbrokers:
They are always rich. (He meant the Asiatic
wealth,—hoards of gold, not a checking account
at a bank.)
They are uncanny.
They lead isolated, unhappy lives.
They always have a beautiful daughter (one
only) to fall heir to the riches.
This daughter dreams of noble lovers, but no
Japanese, whatever his rank, be it noble, humble,
or decayed (or, for that matter, no matter how
much in debt he may be to her father), would ever
throw away his pride to wed a pawnbroker’s
daughter. Thus she is left to grieve out her heart
in the midst of her father’s luxury.
A Japanese believes certain things patriotically.
I know that Hori does not believe these same
things intellectually, for I was once rude enough
to continue an argument until he capitulated
intellectually—but for the love of country and
the required loyalty to what should be, he also[162]
keeps to the beliefs which he should have as
a Japanese. After all, juxtapositioned to such
faith, mere intellectual judgment does seem lacking
in vital fluid.
The hiatus in Hori’s Japanese life—the foreign
period and influence—began when he was of the
high school age and went to America. Thus,
at the time when the mind is supposed to be most
receptive, he was separated from the traditions
and ethical customs of his homeland, and he made
no return home until he had left his American university.
A peculiar duality may come from such
a training. It would be impossible otherwise, for
instance, that one individual should really appreciate
both a symphony orchestra and a samisen,
not so much from the angle of technical divergence
in the use of notes, tones, and scales as in
aesthetic comparison. To any human being with
emotional sensitiveness and response, not possessing
a dual personality, acknowledgment of the
rights of the symphony would seem to preclude
those of the samisen.
I had lost my Japanese pipe. Those little iron
bowls continue to be a most admirable luxury
through all of the days that one is in the land of
their invention. When the traveller leaves the
shores of Japan he takes away with him packages[163]
of silken tobacco and his pipe, only to find that
he never lights it again. The charm is broken
when the circle is broken, and the circle, I suppose,
is a unity when one is lying on the cushions
of a balcony overlooking a garden, and a maid
brings the charcoal hibachi and a pot of tea.
You touch the bowl of the pipe to the fire and
then—three puffs and a half. You knock the ash
into a bamboo cup. Perhaps the maid refills
the pipe, touches it to the charcoal, and hands it
to you again.
Ordinarily these pipes are sold everywhere, but
at Narii we could not find them. When we were
walking into Shiogiri I asked Hori to help me
keep an eye on the shops as we passed. After a
time he said: “Here we are. Here’s a one-price
store.”
We had not come upon just such a shop before.
While the stock and the arrangement was purely
native, the atmosphere of the place was distinctly
un-Japanese. A little of everything was for sale,
but instead of the selling being a social ceremony,
the shopkeeper and his wife and his sons and his
daughters were expeditious clerks and not hosts.
The entering customer asked for what he wished
to see, and a price tag told him the cost. That
was the beginning and the end of any bargaining.
[164]
In the conventional shop the buyer sits down
leisurely, after removing his geta, and perhaps
has a cup of tea. If an ordinary utility is wished,
the negotiating is necessarily devoid of much opportunity
for extended approach, consideration,
and conclusion, but it is always to be remembered
that our idea of what is a waste of time may be
the Japanese idea of a valuably used moment.
The little shops have no opening and closing hours.
Literally, there is all the time there is. The
clerk does not sell eight, nine, or ten hours of
his day to his employer. He sells all of it.
As it is impossible to keep at high pressure for
maybe twenty hours of the twenty-four (and
twenty hours is not an exaggeration in some instances)
nature’s insistence for rest has to come
out of the working day. The fact that the workers
are not awaiting the striking of a clock for
their liberty, but are more or less taking it as
it comes, accounts for what is often a mystery
to travellers, the easy gaiety of a busy Japanese
street. Workmen put down their tools and stop
for a visit; the shopkeeper chats indefinitely
with a customer; the maids at the inns have
plenty of time to light pipes for the guests and
pour tea. Our idea is that the individual’s liberty
begins at the sharp demarcation of the hour[165]
which ceases to belong to the employer. After
the wanderer has lived for a time in the midst
of the Oriental system, the impression comes that
time is a continuous flow and that it is not a succession
of intervals as it is with us. The people
of the East have even found a counteracting
thrust to oppose the tyranny of the railroad schedule.
By arriving at the station indefinitely early
they can show their contempt for definite departures.
While we were buying my new twelve-sen pipe
in the Shiogiri one-price store, Hori commented
with obvious emphasis several times that he was
pleased that the prices were so carefully marked
on the tags. As smoking may at any time become
a ceremony, I spent many minutes in my
selection, and through these minutes Hori kept
dropping his pointed comments, but I stored away
the impression of his satisfaction over the price
tags to be asked about later. An appropriate
time did not come for several days. An hour
came when we were lounging on an inn balcony
in the soft night air.
It seemed that our method of shopping was the
disturbing pressure against Hori’s peace of mind.
We two foreigners undoubtedly had many flaws
which came to light under the wear of intimate[166]
association, but it was this one which at last
drove Hori to the verge where he had to unburden
his feelings. In the curio shops, or wherever
we were making purchases, when we came
upon something that interested us, we immediately
asked: “How much?” It had been natural,
when Hori was with us, to rely upon him
to interpret rather than to employ our own
cumbrous methods of transmitting ideas. As
soon as we received an intimation of the bargain
price we proceeded to the bargaining and
continued until we arrived at what was presumably
the lowest compromise of the shopkeeper.
Hori had also noticed that we sometimes put off
deciding whether we really wished to purchase
until we discovered the eventual price. We quite
reversed the ceremonial purchase making enacted
by a Japanese gentleman. As Hori witnessed it,
the difference was meaningful. The Japanese collector
looks first of all at an object to see whether
it merits his attention. If it does, there follows
an extended conversation about its intrinsic excellence.
Every question as to artistic value,
authenticity, age, workmanship, uniqueness—these
are all settled before a word about the price arises.
If the object does not equal his demands of it, the
collector departs without inquiry about the money[167]
value—for why should he be interested in the
cost of an article if not in the article itself?
Hori shook his head sadly. “You always ask
right away: ‘How much?’” he said. “That
sounds very mercenary to us. It looks as if you
were more interested in cheapness than quality.”
We had not suspected that Hori was writhing
when, under the pressure of our Occidental impetus,
he had been asking for us the questions of
price. As a matter of fact, be it to his credit
and our discredit, despite the simplification of
his quick interpreting against our imperfect use of
the few words that we did know, when it came
to the detail of price our efforts often seemed to
be able to effect a more extraordinary drop from
the original quotation than when such arguing
was put off until all other details were settled.
It is true that the merchants who have really
fine things will not show nor sell their best to
customers whose appreciation they doubt, but
it may also be true that as far as we did have
appreciation, we made up our minds more quickly
than does the Japanese collector, and thus the
stages of consideration which Hori missed were
not so much lacking as they were abbreviated.
The standards of the samurai when he goes
forth to make purchases should not be confused[168]
as being an index to the methods of modern
Japan in attacking the world’s markets. In such
trading there is no nation which is more intent
upon giving the customer what the customer
thinks he wants, and price and profit are sufficiently
an affair of cold business to be safely
refrigerated against any germs of sentimentalism.
Hori was speaking as the son of the civilization
which flowered in the feudal days. Whatever
that civilization was, it was not commercial. In
that old régime the shopkeeper was only a shopkeeper,
and a discussion of ethics in trade occupied
little space in the code of honour of the
nation. When Hori’s fathers stopped to buy a
fan or a bronze or a roll of brocade or sandals
for their feet, or whatever it might be that they
wished, bargaining stopped as soon as they
reached the end of their patience—and they were
most impatient warriors. They might arrogantly
pay what was asked, or, if their patience
was too far gone, they might lop off the head
of the obdurate merchant. The last probability
had a tendency to keep prices fairly near to an
equitable level when the two-sworded men were
purchasers.
It is not an appreciated trait in the modern
world to have contempt for money. Japan’s nobility,[169]
when the Shogun ruled, had sincere contempt
for money. There is something dramatic,
even noble, in having such a contempt, but it
must be said that it is a much easier possession
to maintain if back of it the possessors have the
inalienable ownership of their landed estates.
The descendants of the ancient orders in Japan
do not own the land to-day and, examining their
position in the cold light of fact, their contempt
for any consideration of things commercial is
the sign-board finger pointing to their eventual
elimination. It was the miracle of all time when
those noble families responded to the necessity of
the new order, forced upon Japan by the outside
world, and gave up their feudal right to the land
to the Emperor for a more democratic distribution.
They not only surrendered their land in response
to the Emperor’s edict, but they metamorphosed
their sons into statesmen to help carry
through the ideal. Their children went to foreign
lands and laboured at menial tasks to learn the
ways of the seiyo-jin. Returning home they recognized
that the standards both of commerce and
ordinary trade had to be raised. Their encouragement
to their country to proceed along new
lines was practical and effective; nevertheless few
were the sons of the nobility who themselves entered[170]
the world of commerce. Rather was it that
they encouraged a middle class to rise. Even
with no longer a perpetuation of power through
landed estates, the old aristocracy has so far
continued to exert the preponderating influence
in national leadership. Can they continue to
cherish a contempt of money and at the same
time withstand the power of the new commercial
class which is becoming richer every year while
they are becoming poorer? Can they prove that,
even in this age, honour and loyalty need not have
to go hand in hand with money, and that poverty,
second only to death, is not the great leveller?
Curiously, indeed, the abandon which comes
from contempt for wealth by this class in Japan
has had a bullish effect in one small department
of world trade. Westerners first thought of
Japan as a nation so given over to aestheticism
that it used its hours in creating beautiful works
of art and then admiring them. In those early
days examples of their highest achievement in art
were to be found at incredibly low prices. For
a decade or two after its ports were forced open
by the foreigner, the country was absorbed in
adjusting itself to meet conditions unique to its
traditions. It was a revolution which had to endure
the strain of the uncompromising lavishness[171]
of war without the excitement of war. In such
a period “priceless” art objects had their price.
Those objects of art had been so intimately associated
with the calm of the old order in its
social and religious system that when that order
gave ground the Japanese disregarded such possessions.
It was then that gold lacquer boxes
were either sold for a sum equal to the mere
salvage of the gold or else melted in the furnace.
Those first years of readjustment presented the
glorious days for the foreign collector. Then
came reaction. To their own bewilderment the
Japanese awoke to find that their love for the
beautiful had not been merely an appendage of
the feudal system. They began to compete for
their own treasures. Prices began to advance to
the mystification of the foreign buyers. The Japanese
aristocrats were entering into collecting with
that abandon which can exist only through sincere
contempt for money. Thus it is that very few
fine things now come out of Japan. Japan is
poor, desperately poor, and it would seem that our
millionaires should easily outbid them, but to a
mind commercially trained, eventually there enters
a consideration of price. To the son of the old
Japanese nobility there is no such consideration
except the limit of his purse. I heard the story[172]
of a young nobleman who desired a certain Korean
antique. His wealth was about six hundred
thousand yen. Like the Roman youth who shook
dice, hazarding himself to become the slave of his
opponent should he lose, this young Japanese entered
the bidding until it was his last yen which
bought the antiquity. The dilettante does not
bid successfully against that spirit.'),
('Chapter 3: THE END OF THE TRAIL', 'Whether or no the Bosen-ka inn of Kofu does
possess a wide reputation for comfort, it should
deservedly have it. O-Shio-san was the name of
the maid. This means O-Salt-san, but we renamed
her “O-Sato-san,” which means Miss
Sugar. She said that she had been at the inn
for fifteen years, but until the day before there
had never come a foreigner, and now there were
two besides ourselves. I do not understand how
such immunity could have been possible in a city
the size of Kofu. However, the fact that there
were Occidentals under the roof of the hostelry
at that moment was proved by sight and sound.
After the many days of hearing only the Japanese
cadence, the sound of Western tongues was almost
startling. The large room, which became
ours, was in the main building and faced the garden.
We could look across to the wing where
the two foreigners were sitting on their balcony.
They were eating tiffin and talking vigorously.
One was a short, black-haired, merry Frenchman,[272]
the other a tall, blond, closely-cropped German.
They spoke either language as the words came.
Quite likely they had been in the same university
in some European city, and their travelling
was a leisurely grand tour. They could not have
been hurried or they would not have taken time
to search out Kofu. Their gay spirit was charming.
They looked into the eyes of the world with
a friendly gaze and the world smiled back at
them. Within the month, France and Germany
were to declare the implacable war.
High-pitched footbridges linked together the
miniature islands of the garden and carried a
labyrinthine path over the lotus-covered pond.
Lying on the cool, clean mats of our room, sheltered
from the sun, the thought of antique shops
lured me not. I declared for contemplation, but
Hori and O-Owre-san wandered forth. O-Shio-san
brought fresh tea and a brazier of glowing
charcoal for my pipe. My contemplation began
and ended with a luxurious enjoyment of the view
of the garden. Through the quiet air came the
slow, deep tones of temple gongs. It was a day
of special masses. My thoughts found rest in
sensuous nothingness and I drifted tranquilly in a
glory of inaction. Another day of such devotion
to passivity might have started the unfolding[273]
within me of the leaves of appreciation for the
philosophy of Nirvana, but in the morning some
illogical shame for such laziness urged me into
joining the pilgrimage of Hori and O-Owre-san
to the Sen-sho cañon.
O-SHIO-SAN IN THE BOSEN-KA INN GARDEN.
The deep, sharp cleft in the granite through
which that mountain stream pitches has a rugged
beauty. Most perversely, if we had discovered
the grandeur for ourselves and had not been
over-persuaded by the innkeeper to take the long
walk, we would undoubtedly have been more enthusiastic,
but as it was we decided that we would
rather have spent the day wandering about in
Kofu. Even the unscalable cliffs took on sophistication
from the well-worn path below, which proclaimed
that the view had been the conventional
thing for centuries. Despite all the instruction
which the innkeeper had given us about distances
and direction, he had escaped correctness in every
detail. As often, there was no information obtainable
from the heavily-laden coolies tramping
along the way. If there is really any mystery
which separates East and West it is the East’s
oblivious indifference to time and space and our
complete inability to understand the working of
a mind which has over and over again been on a
journey and yet has never considered it sufficiently[274]
worth while to take cognizance either of
the distance or the hours.
As we were walking over the flat plain to the
beginning of the valley, we stopped for a few
minutes to watch a field drill of the conscript
army. It was a very hot day, but the uniforms
seemed designed for a Manchurian winter. A few
of the men had fallen out of the ranks from exhaustion.
We heard later that during that hot
week in one of the provinces some officer with a
new theory had issued an order against the drinking
of water during drill, and that the lives of a
number of soldiers had been sacrificed to sunstroke.
It stirred up an angry scandal. My
knowledge of positive thirst would have made me
a hanging judge if I had sat on the inquiring
court-martial.
We walked on and had forgotten the drill when
four or five men and a panting officer overtook
us. They entered into a sharp debate with Hori.
Finally they dropped behind but followed us until
we were a mile away. They had suspected that
we were Russian spies.
We lingered in Kofu for several days but at
last again took the old road which runs through
the long valleys to Tokyo. This trail from Kofu
on is rather closely followed by the railway just[275]
as is the Tokaido in the South. I do not know
whether it was in honour of (or in disgust at)
all such modernities that feudal Yedo changed
its name to Tokyo. The capital was our destination
and we had intended keeping along the
direct road but upon a whim (and a look at the
map) we suddenly decided to climb the ridge
between us and Fuji-san, and then to encircle
the base of the sacred mountain until we should
find again the Tokaido which we had forsaken
at Nagoya.
It was at the moment of this decision that the
demon bicycle collapsed utterly. If it had acquiesced
to the change of route it would have had
to submit to being carried on the back of a coolie.
I have not dared to record all the subtle ingenuities
of that mechanical contrivance which it had
concocted from time to time to achieve its ends.
Its soul had been factoried under a star hostile
to human dignity. It could bring about a loss
of face to the most innocent who crossed its path.
It had the pride of never having been successfully
outwitted, and its soul was as proud as the soul
of Lucifer. It had no intention of submitting to
the indignity of being packed on a coolie nor to
have the world see it with its wheels wobbling
idly in the air. In desperate determination it[276]
committed hara-kiri. Its suicide was heroically
completed. As I recorded in the chapter when
the bicycle was introduced, Hori gave a shining
piece of silver to the coolie to see that the remains
had suitable interment. Peace be to those twisted
spokes and to that jerry-contraptioned frame!
About noon we found a man with a horse.
The man hired himself out to run along behind
and Hori mounted the animal. The summit between
us and Fuji was only about three thousand
feet above our heads but as we continually had
to go down into deep valleys and come up again
our gross climbing took many steps. The
thatched villages were very primitive, and the
people were very nude. The homes which clung
desperately to the edges of the cliffs must have
had to breed a special race of children to survive
tumbles, just as in the villages underneath on
the shores of the small lakes, they must have
had to breed an instinctive knowledge of floating.
The houses of those peasants were as
much a part of nature as are birds’ nests, and
they so welded themselves into the unity of
the view from the ridges that we did not even
think to call them picturesque.
Poor Hori had not a moment when he could
sit perpendicularly on his steed. The road was[277]
either a scramble or a slide. Finally he dismissed
the coolies and the horse. We were at
the beginning of a path which was built in sharp
zigzags up the side of the mountain. A half-dozen
coolie girls with huge chests strapped on
their shoulders stopped at a spring and sat down
for a moment to fan their flushed, pretty faces.
They told us that this was the last climb but they
were indefinite about the remaining distance or
the time that it would take. It had been our
plan to get to the top in time for the sunset view
of Fuji and the lakes. Perhaps the demon bicycle
had been granted one last diabolical wish.
We were within a few feet of the summit, the
air was seemingly clear, when down came a thick,
wet cloud from nowhere at all, and our expectation
for the crowning glory of the day vanished.
All the way down the other side of the mountain
the fog hung over us but it lifted when
we reached the shore of Lake Shoji. A village
straggled along the water edge. We knew that
across the lake was a foreign hotel, but if we
had not known it we should nevertheless have had
some such suspicion. From the attitude of the
villagers it was evident that we had traversed
again into tourist territory. The mild, jocular[278]
incivility of the natives of any tourist resort any
place in the world, except when there is some
restraint under the immediacy of employment,
is innate and needs no aggravation for its flowering.
We were tourists, therefore we must be
imbecilic. Derisive hooting followed our ears
when we started walking around the lake instead
of conventionally taking a boat. Between the
fog on the mountain top and our reception in the
village we were somewhat out of sympathy with
the last hour of the day, and we were even less
happy when we reached the hotel, and it was
brought to our attention that we had failed to
remember that foreign prices prevail at foreign
hotels. True, there were excellent reasons why
the charges should be higher than at the native
inns. The foreign supplies had to be brought
long distances on coolie back. This knowledge,
however, did not increase the number of yen in
our pockets. We were in a fitting mood for turning
away and pushing on to some isolated village.
Such a mood can drive a good bargain and the
end was that we were given a room with three
iron cots at a minimum charge. I must pay this
tribute to that iron cot: I relaxed on its springs
in an abandonment to sleep which I shall never
forget. But there were other things foreign[279]
which were not so pleasant. To have to wait
until eight o’clock for a formal dinner when we
were accustomed to having meals served at the
clapping of our hands, and to have to thump over
rough board floors after we had known the refinement
of soft matting, and to have to endure
all the other half-achieved attempts at foreign
service—well, “going native,” as the Britishers
say in final judgment, “had been the ruining of
us.”
Waiting until the late foreign breakfast hour
in the morning almost numbed the cheerfulness
that had risen in me from the exhilarating sleep
on the luxurious bed of springs, but the day was
shining in such perfection when we found an unfrequented
trail north of the chain of lakes, and
Fuji-san was resting so clearly in the crystal
air across the pine tree plain, that we quickly
dumped into a maw of forgetfulness any remembrance
of such mundane annoyances as foreign
hotels. It may have been that volcanic gases were
breaking through the clefts in the rocks and that
the fumes inspired us with a Delphic madness;
our mood became ecstatic. We unburdened ourselves
of wild and soaring theories of art and
religion, of love and life—and there were theories
that came forth which we had never dreamed[280]
existed in cosmos. We scattered these inspired
words in wanton waste as if we were on a journey
to some world where such wealth would be dross.
The town which we found for the night was
on what is called “the Shoji route around Fuji.”
We avoided the semi-foreign hotel but that did
not save us from being tourists. The native inn
had ready for us in the morning a bill almost twice
as large as it should have been. In consequence
we added no “tea-money.” If we had, we should
have gone from the village penniless. In all our
wandering this was the first deliberate overcharge,
and in one way it may have been justified in the
opinion of the mistress. She had probably learned
from the semi-foreign hotel across the street that
foreigners know not the custom of tea-money and
ignorantly pay only the bill that is presented without
adding a suitable and proportionate present.
Truly we were now in the domain not only of
the foreign tourist but of the native pilgrim as
well. All day we walked through the towns which
serve as starting points for the different routes of
ascent for Fuji. It was the height of the season
for the sacred climb and the towns, purveying
every imaginable necessity and souvenir, had
mushroomed into crowded camps. We were unworthy
guests. As far as our purchasing ability[281]
was concerned, a postcard was an outside luxury.
When we reached Gotemba we sat down for a
conference, following the rule of “when in doubt
drink a pot of tea.”
By rail to Yokohama was fifty-one miles. We
had leisurely covered about twenty-five miles that
day. Even if we should make ten or fifteen miles
more before night, there would be a sufficiently
long, scorching, penniless day to come. The
country was not new to us as we had both tramped
through the exploited Miyanoshita and Kamakura
districts. “Since these things are so,” I made
argument, “let’s use our remaining coppers to buy
tickets on the express to Yokohama.” As no one’s
pride sufficiently demanded that we had to take
the fifty-one miles on foot, this plan was our final
agreement.
Our linen suits were perhaps not as freshly
laundered as those of the other haughty seiyo-jins
who were riding on the first and second-class
cars of the train, but otherwise our poverty did
not particularly proclaim itself. We walked to
our hotel in Yokohama and took rooms, relying
that future funds would come out of the letter
which was supposedly waiting at the bank for me.
In the meantime in the bag which had been forwarded
from Nagoya I found a two-dollar American[282]
bill. This gift we cashed into yen and sat
through the evening on a terrace over the bund
along the water front, sipping forgotten coffee
and ordering long, iced, fresh lemon drinks. A
steamer had landed that day and at the next table
to ours was a charming group of American girls.
They were filled with enthusiasm for the exotic.
The soft, evening air, the passing life along the
street, and the gay tables carried me back to my
own first night in Japan, which had been spent
eleven years before on that very terrace.
The hoped-for letter was waiting for me at the
bank. The amount above the exact sum necessary
for my steamship ticket had been intended for insurance
against extras. It was now necessary
for mere existence. We entered into an infinite
calculation of finance down to the ultimate sen.
Yokohama was no place for economy and we
shook off its dust for that of Tokyo and were
happy again in a native inn. With our linen suits
laundered, we called on old friends and shopped
betimes on credit. It was a rather queer sensation
to be bargaining for luxuries when a mere
bona fide payment of a ’ricksha charge meant a
most delicate readjustment of our entire capital.
Dealers were quite willing to forward boxes to
America with hardly more guarantee than our[283]
promise to pay sometime. I felt that if we were
to ask them suddenly for ten yen in cash our
credit would have crashed to earth. Nevertheless
we were confident of our dole outlasting our needs.
We lived our moments gaily. We saved yen to
pay the inn bill, and our boat was scheduled to
sail on a certain day.
Hori was determined that our last day should
be worthy and memorable. Through friends he
arranged that we should meet Count Okuma, the
Premier of the Empire. We had made most of
our visits about the city on foot, and on one of
the hottest days we had walked the round trip of
a dozen miles to have afternoon tea with a former
Japanese diplomat to America and his family,
trusting that his sense of humour would forgive
our perspiration, but one does not arrive thus at
a palace door. Great was the excitement at the
inn when ’ricksha men were called and our destination
was given out. We dashed away and
careened around the corners at tremendous speed.
It was at least the second hottest day of the year,
but the coolies realized that they were part of a
ceremony and that their duty was to arrive streaming,
panting, and exhausted.
Count Okuma, on his son’s arm, entered the
small reception room into which we were shown.[284]
(The bullet of a fanatic shattered the bone of his
leg when he was a young man.) Count Okuma
is almost the last survivor of that group who
directed the miracle of transforming the Japan
of feudalism into the modern nation.
We drank tea and asked formal questions. Following
some turn of the conversation—Count
Okuma was speaking of loyalty—we inquired, as
we had of the ancient schoolmaster of Kama-Suwa:
“Can virtue be taught?”
The expression in the eyes of the Premier’s
great, handsome head had been passive as he
had acquiesced in what had been said up to that
time. Now his expression became positive. He
spoke slowly as if he were summing up the belief
and experience of a lifetime.
“When Japan, after her centuries of hermitage,
had suddenly either to face the West and to compete
successfully with you, or to sink into being a
tributary and exploited people, our greatest necessity
in patriotism was to recognize instantly that
in the physical and material world we had to learn
everything from you. Our social, commercial, and
governmental methods were suited only to the organization
of society which we then had. We
discovered that your world is a world of commerce
and competition; that the achieving of[285]
wealth from the profits of trade demands training,
efficiency, ingenuity, and initiative. Our
civilization had not developed these qualities in
us. We could only hope that we had latent ability.
Furthermore, observation of you taught us
to realize the value of physical power. We saw
that mere superior cleverness and ability in the
competition to live is not sufficient until backed
by a preparedness of force. America was our
great teacher and we shall never cease to be
grateful. In the physical world we had everything
to learn from you, and to-day we must constantly
remember that we have only begun to
learn.
“It was our overwhelming task to begin at the
beginning, and we should have had no success if it
had not been for the moral qualities of the Japanese
people. These virtues cannot be taught—merely
as they are required. They are the spiritual
and moral inheritage from the past. In the
avalanche of Western ideas which came upon us, it
was our great work to pick, to choose, and to
adapt. These ideas were the ideas of the commercial
world. There are those who say that
Japan in taking over these standards of materialism
relinquished the priceless inheritance of its
own spiritual life. No! We have had everything[286]
to learn from you in methods, but that
should not be confused with spiritual values. I
do not mean mere creeds and dogma, but to the
essence, the great fundamentals of all true religion.
“It is possible that sometime in the future the
outside world may discover that it will have need
to come to us for the values that are ours through
our great moral inheritance of loyalty. In a material
way we can never pay back to you our
obligation for having been taught your material
lessons. But it may be that Western nations
have put too great faith in materialism and that
they will arrive at the bitter knowledge that the
fruit of life is death unless the faith of men
reaches out for something beyond the material.
Then, if we of Japan have humbly guarded our
spiritual wealth, the world may come to ask the
secret of our spiritual values as we went to you
to ask the inner secret of your material values.”');
