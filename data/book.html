<h2>FOREWORD<br>
<span class="titlefont">FROM THE ALHAMBRA TO KYOTO</span></h2>
<p>It was spring and it was Spain. Sunset
brought the white-haired custodian of the Court
of the Lions to the balcony overhanging my fountain.
His blue coat bespoke officialdom but his
Andalusian lisp veiled this suggestion of compulsion.
His wishes for my evening’s happiness,
nevertheless, were to be interpreted as a request
for my going. The Alhambra had to be locked up
for the night.</p>
<p>I was lying outstretched on the stones of Lindaroxa’s
Court with my head against a pillar.
The last light of the April sun had scaled the
walls and was losing itself among the top-most
bobbing oranges of Lindaroxa’s tree. To dream
there must be to have one’s dreams come true,
some inheritance from Moorish alchemy.</p>
<p>Despite the setting, I was dreaming nothing
of the Alhambra, not even of Lindaroxa. I was
thinking of a friend of irresponsible imagination
but of otherwise responsibility. I was wondering<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
where he could be. On the previous summer we
had walked the highroads of England and I had
found him a most satisfying disputatious companion
of enquiring mind. We had talked somewhat
of a similar wandering in Japan, a vagabondage
free from cicerones and away from the show
places, but although we had treated this variety
of imagining with due respect, we had never an
idea of transmuting it into action.</p>
<p>The Alhambra had to be locked up for the
night. The custodian bowed low, and I bowed
low, in unhurried obligation to dignity, and I
walked away to my inn. There I found a cablegram
from America. It read:</p>
<p>“Can meet you Kyoto June two months’ walking.”</p>
<p>It was signed by the other dreamer of the Two-Sworded
Trails.</p>
<p>I cabled back, “yes.” The message gone, I
awoke to the reality of time and space. All Europe,
Siberia, Manchuria, and Korea spread out
their distances on the map and were lying between
me and the keeping of my promise.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>It was in the darkness of midnight and it was
raining when I stepped off the express to the
Kyoto platform. For a month the world had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
been revolving giddily under railway carriage
succeeding railway carriage until it seemed that
the changing peoples outside the car windows
could be taking on their ceaseless variety only
through some illusion within my own eyes.</p>
<p>I stood for a while in the shelter of the overhanging,
dripping roof of the Kyoto station
awaiting some providential development, but probably
the local god of wayfarers did not judge my
plight worry of special interposition. Finally I
found a drenched youth in a stupor of sleep between
the shafts of his ’ricksha. His dreams were
evidently depressing, for he awoke with appreciation
for the escape. We bent over his paper
lantern and at last coaxed a spurt of flame from
a box of unspeakable matches. (The government
decrees that matches must be given away and not
sold by the tobacconists. Japan’s spirit of the art
of giving should not be judged by this item. The
generosity is in the acceptance of the matches.)
I climbed into the ’ricksha and stowed myself
away under the hood, naming the inn which had
been appointed by cablegram for the meeting
place. The boy pattered along in his straw sandals
at full speed through the mist, shouting
hoarsely at the corners. At last he dug his heels
into the pebbles and stopped, and pounded at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the inn door until someone came and slid back
the bolts.</p>
<p>Yes, the clerk answered my question, a guest
with the name of Owre had arrived that day at
noon and had sat up for me until midnight. He
had left word that I should be taken to his room.
Thus I was led through dark halls until we came
to the door. We pushed it open and called into
the darkness. Back came a welcome—somewhat
sleepy. The clerk struck a match and I discovered
my vagabond companion crawling out
from under the mosquito netting of his four-poster.
Between us we had covered twenty thousand
miles for that handshake.</p>
<p>“It’s the moment to be highly dramatic,”
he said with an eloquent flourish of his pajam’d
arm, and he sent the clerk for a bottle of native
beer. It came, warm and of infinite foam, but
we managed to find a few drops of liquid at the
bottom with which to drink a toast. The toast
was to “The Road.”</p>

<h2 class="no-break">I<br>
<span class="titlefont">THE QUEST FOR O-HORI-SAN</span></h2>
<p>After our melodramatic toast of the night before
it would have been only orthodox to have said
good-bye to our Occidental inn at sunrise and
to have sought the road. But we had a call to
make. The fulfilling of the obligation proved to
be momentous. There is one never-to-be-broken
rule for the foreigner in the Orient: He must consider
himself always to be of extreme magnitude
in the perspective, and that any action which concerns
himself is momentous. If Asia had possessed
this supreme self-concern, she might to-day
be playing political chess with colonies in Europe.
The details of our call are thus set down in faithful
sequence.</p>
<p>“If ever you come to Japan, be sure to look me
up.” This had been the farewell of Kenjiro Hori
when he said good-bye to his university days in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
America. Hori’s affection for America had had
the vigour which marks the vitality of Japanese
loyalty. He had always singled out our better
qualities with gratifying disregard for opposites.</p>
<p>We were, however, without an address except
that we thought he might be in Kobe; but it
seemed unreasonable that after travelling all the
way to the Antipodes we should then be baulked
by a mere detail. In the faith of this logic we
took an early train to Kobe, and the first sign
that we saw read: “Information Bureau for
Foreigners.”</p>
<p>The man in uniform peering out of the box
window was so smiling and so evidently desirous
of being helpful that whether we had needed
information or not, it would have been exceedingly
discourteous not to have asked some question.
We inquired the address of Dr. Kenjiro Hori.
The information dispenser thumbed all his heap
of directories. He appeared to be unravelling
his thread by a most intricate system of cross
reference. Then he looked at us with another
smile.</p>
<p>“Did you find it?” we asked.</p>
<p>“I find no address,” said he, “but I tell ’ricksha
boys take you. Ah, so!”</p>
<p>Such a challenge was impossible to refuse.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
We got into the ’rickshas and the men bent their
necks and jerked the wheels into motion with
strange disregard for any bee-line direction to
any particular place. It appeared to be a most
casual choice whether we took one corner or
another. This rambling went on for some time.
Suddenly they held back on the shafts and said:
“Here!” We were at the door of a wholesale
importing house. No one within had ever heard
of O-Hori-san. When we came back to the
street with this information the coolies seemed
not at all surprised. They shrugged their shoulders
at our mild expostulation as if implying, “Of
course, if he isn’t here he must be some other
place.”</p>
<p>After another panting dash they stopped and
said: “Here!” It was obvious without inquiring
that Hori could not be in that shallow, open-fronted
shop. “Very well,” the shoulders answered
us and on we went. We stopped for
another time with the now familiar “Here!” We
had traversed half Kobe. Our futile questions
seemed to have nothing to do with any next step.
Strangely, instead of having lost our faith it had
been growing that by some system the coolies
were following the quest. At this stop, when
we looked inside the entrance, there was the name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of Dr. Kenjiro Hori on a brass plate. We walked
up the stairs and rang a bell and inquired for Dr.
Hori of the boy who came.</p>
<p>We asked him to tell O-Hori-san that O-Owre-san
and O-Kirt-land-san would like to see him.
Of all arrangements of consonants (w’s, r’s, k’s,
and l’s) to harass the Japanese tongue, our two
names stand in the first group of the first list of
impossibles. We could overhear the distressed
boy’s struggle with “O-Owre-san.” I was impressed
that from that instant Alfred Owre became
“O-Owre-san.” It was a secular confirmation too
positive to be gainsaid.</p>
<p>Small wonder then that Hori had not the slightest
idea who was waiting at the door; but his surprise,
when he appeared, was so smoothed out and
repressed in his formal <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#samurai" id="a-samurai" class="pginternal">samurai</a></i> welcome that we
were tempted into moody thinking that through
some psychosis the frightful slaughter of our
names had destroyed his remembrance of our
rightful personalities.</p>
<p>Friends appeared and were introduced with
ceremonial formalism. We sat in a circle and
sipped iced mineral water. Hori inquired politely
of our plans and then sat back in silence
behind his thick spectacles. The icy temperature
of the mineral water was the temperature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the verve of the conversation. The day itself
was rather hot; a damp, depressing heat. I tried
to fan off the flies which stuck tenaciously with
sharp, sudden buzzings.</p>
<p>Of all varieties of uncreative activity, the analyzing
of moods brings the least compensation—but
that does not mean avoidance. During that
hour a disturbing remoteness to everyday reality
rasped as if something untoward had been conjured
up. O-Owre-san and I talked, trying to
explain our plans. We repeated that we hadn’t
any desire to visit the great places, but our saying
so sounded childish and impertinent,—very
tiresome. A dignified ancient kept forcing us
into a position of defence. To put us out of
ease was his most remote wish, of course, but he
did insist with patriotic eloquence (suggesting
a Californian defending his climate) that the
show places deserved to be paid respect. We
insisted that our tourist consciences had been
appeased long before, and that we now intended
to run away from foreign hotels, from the Honourable
Society of Guides, from the Imperial
Welcome Society, from all cicerones, and from
all centres where the customs and conveniences
of our Western variety of civilization are so cherishingly
catered to.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>“But,” interrupted Hori, “you do not understand.
You will find no one prepared for foreigners.
You will find not one word of English.
You must not do such a thing.” With Japan so
earnestly providing the proper accommodations
at the proper places, it was not playing the game,
so to speak, to refuse.</p>
<p>When an argument of policy is between an
amateur and an expert (particularly so when
between a foreigner and a native) the tyro can
afford to compromise on not one atom of his
ignorance. If he concedes at all he will be overwhelmed
completely. We refused Hori’s warnings,
remaining impervious to any advice which
did not further our plan of action exactly as
outlined.</p>
<p>“Very well, then,” said Hori, “I shall have
to go with you.”</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>Under the excitement of talking plans Hori
slipped out of his formalism, and became exactly
his old-time self. Until the following week, however,
he would not be able to turn his solicitude
into action. He did not lose his cataclysm of
positive doubt over entrusting the Empire in our
hands, but as there was no escape from leaving
us to our own devices for those days (and we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
made known a certain vanity in our own resources)
he at length agreed to meet us in Nagoya,
and we planned a route which would bring us there
with our rendezvous at the European hotel.</p>

<h2>II<br>
<span class="titlefont">THE ANCIENT TOKAIDO</span></h2>
<p>It was the morning of our last sleep in <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#seiyo-jin" id="a-seiyo-jin" class="pginternal">seiyo-jin</a></i>
beds. I dreamed that I was still dreaming in
Lindaroxa’s Court. O-Owre-san shook my four-poster
and begged me to consider the matter-of-factness
of rolling out from my mosquito netting
and taking a bite of cold breakfast. The sensuous
breeze of the East, which comes for a brief hour
with the first light of the sun, was blowing the
curtains back from the window. I was willing
to consider the getting up and the eating of the
breakfast and I was willing to call both endeavours
matter-of-fact, but the imagination that it was
to be the first day on the highroad belonged to
no such mere negativity of living.</p>
<p>I began packing and was inspired to improvise
a wonderful ballad. It was concerned with the
beginning of trails. O-Owre-san was busy and
was uninterested in my stanzas. He might very
well have served genius by taking them down.
The all-inclusiveness embraced, I remember, a
master picture of cold dawn in the Rockies, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
pack ponies snorting, biting, and bucking; and I
sang blithely of every other sort of first morning
start, embroidering the memories of their roaring
language and their unpackable dunnage. But in
Japan one does not roar—or one roars alone—and
I had known just what was going into my
rucksack for weeks.</p>
<p>Our route was to be the famed Tokaido, that
ancient road running between the great capitals
of the West and the East, from Kyoto to Tokyo.
We were to find its first stretch at the turn to
the left when we should cross the bridge over the
Kamo-Gawa. This river cuts Kyoto between
two long rows of houses built on piles and overhanging
its waters. In summer the stream is most
domesticated and gives, charitably, a large area
of its dry bed as a pleasure ground for <i lang="fr">fêtes</i>, but
when the snows are melting back in the hills in
the days of spring and blossoms, it becomes temperamental
and the peasants say that it has drunk
unwisely of <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#sake" id="a-sake" class="pginternal">saké</a></i>. It is then that the water winks
rakishly and splashes the tips of its waves at
pretty <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#geisha" id="a-geisha" class="pginternal">geishas</a></i>, who come to scatter cherry petals
on the current. But we saw only the summer
domesticity on our June morning. A school of
children were wading in the shallow current, fishing
with nets. Their <i lang="ja">kimonos</i> were tied high above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
their sturdy fat legs. We leaned over the rail
and they squinted back into the sun at us and
called out good-morning. Then we stepped off
the bridge and our boots were on the long road
that leads to Tokyo.</p>

<div class="caption" id="ebm_caption1"><p class="center">KYOTO BACK STREETS</p></div>
</div>
<p>Hokusai has pictured the Tokaido in his prints—the
villages and the mountains, the plains and
the sea, the peasants and the pilgrims, the <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#ronin" id="a-ronin" class="pginternal">ronins</a></i>
and the priests. He did add his immortal overlay
to the tradition of the highway’s immortality,
but even the great Hokusai could only be an
incident in the spread of its renown. The Tokaido’s
personality was no less haughty and arrogant
long centuries before the artist. It was built by
the gods, as everyone knows, and not by man.
This may be the reason why it has fallen upon
hard days in these modern times, now that the
race of man has assumed the task of relieving
the weary gods of so many of their duties. Axes
have cut down the cryptomerias for miles because
the trees interfered with telegraph wires; and
furthermore, a new highway has now been built
between the capitals, a road of steel. For most
of the way this new road follows alongside the
old, although sometimes departing in a straighter
line. The vaulting arrogance of all was when
man took the name “The Tokaido” for a railway.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
The trains pass by the ancient shrines of
the wayside with no tarrying for moments of
contemplation. To-day a <i lang="ja">samurai</i>, with a newspaper
under one arm and a lunch box under the
other—his two swords have been thus displaced—goes
from Kyoto to Tokyo in as few hours as
were the days of his father’s journeying.</p>
<p>When the feudal emperors made this pilgrimage
they were carried in silk-hung, lacquered
palanquins, and fierce-eyed, two-sworded retainers
cleared the streets and sealed the houses so
that no prying eyes might violate sancrosanctity.
As for our pilgrimage we appreciated that we
were not sacred emperors and that we were coming
along without announcement. The inhabitants
kept the sides of their houses open and stared out
upon us. We felt free, discreetly, to return their
glances from under the brims of our pith helmets,
but occasionally this freedom felt a panicky restraint
within itself to keep eyes on the road.</p>
<p>In the legend of her famous ride, Lady Godiva,
I believe, had the houses sealed before her approach
as did those deified Nipponese emperors.
We doubted, that early morning, whether the
dwellers along the Tokaido, if they had been
told Lady Godiva’s tale, would have had appreciation
for her chastely wishing not to be seen, except<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
as a mystifying and whimsical eccentricity.
To preserve a deity from mortal eyes—yes, that
might have been conceded as a conventional necessity;
but our surety grew after a short advance
that if the fulfilling of a similar vow by a Nipponese
Lady Godiva should have its penance depending
merely upon the absence of attire, she
could ride her palfrey in the environs of Kyoto
inconspicuously and without exciting comment.
At least such costuming would be in local fashion
the first one or two hours after sunrise.</p>
<p>A mile is a mile the first day, and we had had
three or four miles in the silence which comes
from the feeling that one is really off.</p>
<p>“It’s a good morning for boiling out,” remarked
O-Owre-san, by way of breaking the spell.</p>
<p>We were in a narrow valley walking head on
into the sun. It was an excellent morning for
boiling out.</p>
<p>I suggested that it was a good time to take
the first rest. We found a spot in a temple garden
up a flight of exceedingly steep stone steps.
Usually to throw off one’s pack is to achieve the
supreme emotional satisfaction of laziness, but
on this first essay we failed to relax. It was
perhaps partly that we had not yet boiled out our
Western restlessness among other poisons, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
also there was to be counted in as opposed to the
quietude of the garden a most unrestful suggestion
contributed by a conspicuous sign written in
English and nailed to a post. It read:</p>
<p>“Foreigners Visiting Must Dismount Horses
and Not Ride Into Temple.”</p>
<p>There are visitors in the East whose idea of
sightseeing the heathen gods might not preclude
their riding their horses up onto the lap of the
bronze Buddha of Kamakura; but how the priest
imagined that horses were to be urged up those
stone steps was a mystery veiled from our understanding.
It even created a pride in our alien
blood that we were a race thought to be capable
of such magic.</p>
<p>The Tokaido winds through the city of Otsu.
It enters proudly as the chief street but escapes
between rows of mean houses, becoming as nearly
a characterless lane as the Tokaido can anywhere
be. The town is the chief port of Lake Biwa of
the famed eight views, and it is just beyond this
town that the upstart railway takes itself off, together
with its cindery smoke, on a straighter line
than the Tokaido. The highway bends to the south
in a swinging circle and wanders along for many
a quiet mile before the two meet again. At the
angle of the parting of the old and the new we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
stopped at a rest house for a bottle of <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#ramune" id="a-ramune" class="pginternal">ramune</a></i>.
This beverage is a carbonated, chemically compounded
lemonade. Its wide distribution does
possess one merit. The bottles may often be
used as a sort of guide book. Almost every little
shop along the road has a few bottles cooling in a
wooden bucket of water. Thus, if a stranger is
walking from one town to another and if, as is
inevitable, he has been unable to learn anything
about distances along the way, he may at least
judge that he is approximately half through his
journey when the labels on the bottles change
the address of their origin to that of the town
which he is seeking.</p>
<p>The <i lang="ja">ramune</i> which we had at Otsu was warm
and the shop was stifling and the flies were sticky.
My clinging flannel shirt was unbuttoned, my
sleeves were rolled up, and I had tied a handkerchief
about my head. We carried our bottles out
to a low bench to escape the baked odours of the
shop, and while we were sitting and sipping two
Japanese gentlemen came down the road, looking
very cool under their sun umbrellas and in their
immaculate <i lang="ja">kimonos</i>. Orthodox ambition in the
temperate zone aims for respectability, power, and
property, but in the tropics any temporary struggle,
whether in war or trade, has as its lure the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
reward of a long, aristocratic, cooling calm. Our
Japanese gentlemen, superiorly aloof to the perspiring
world, appeared to be amusedly observing
the habits and customs of the foreigner as exhibited
by us. Their staring rankled. Until then
I had been happy in the exact condition of my
perspiration. Their observance now chilled the
beads on my back. Any number of coolies could
have come and stared, and called us brother—for
all of that—but we were being made to realize
suddenly that in the Orient the lower the blood
temperature the higher the caste mark. The parent
germ of all convention in the world is “not to
lose face.” It has been most highly developed
by the Chinese and the Anglo-Saxon. For the
Chinese it is personal, but it makes the renegade
Anglo-Saxon, despite himself, keep on trying to
hold up his chin in a blind call of blood loyalty to
his own mob when facing the Asiatic.</p>
<p>We picked up our packs and started off. It
was either to retire or nihilistically to hurl the
packs at their immaculateness. Just as we began
to move one of them said: “Do you speak
English?”</p>
<p>The truth must be told that we recanted much
of our wrath after the friendliness of a half-hour’s
roadside palaver. The meeting, however, had a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
uniqueness of experience far beyond anything
merely casual. It allowed us the extraordinary
record that we once did acquire local information
from a Japanese whose conception of daily time
and highroad space had some coincidence with
our Western science of absolute fact. Mr. Yoshida,
he who had called after us, knew that corner
of Japan and he told us about it.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san says: “Certain Japanese inexplicabilities
are extremely ubiquitous.” He thus
confines himself to six words. I cannot. I require
a paragraph. Despite the ubiquitous mystery,
there is always one certainty: Whatever may be
the thought processes of the Japanese concerning
hours, distances, and direction, the inquirer may
be sure of this: the answer will not be concerned
with answering the question. The courteous answerer
earnestly uses his judgment to determine
what reply is likely to be most pleasing. If you
appear weary, or in a hurry, then the distance to
go is never very long. If you appear to be enjoying
your walk, then the distance is a long
way. The village which has been declared just
around the bend of the road may be two <i lang="ja">ri</i> off.
This is the desire to please, inculcated by the
<i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#bushido" id="a-bushido" class="pginternal">Bushido</a></i> creed of honourable conduct. It may be
thought that such paradoxical solicitude becomes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
extremely irritating, but rarely does it. The wish
to help is real, at least, and is not merely the
carelessness of superficiality. The peasant may
tell you that you have but a step to go, but if
you are lost he will turn aside from his own
path and show you the way, though it be for
miles.</p>
<p>We noted down Mr. Yoshida’s details concerning
the inns and villages which we should find
along the way to distant Nagoya. Experience
soon told us to hold fast to his information, no
matter the contradictions that were agreeably
offered in its stead.</p>
<p>We shouldered our packs and again were off.
After a time O-Owre-san said: “I met Mr. Yoshida
once at a dinner in America.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell him so?” I gasped.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san seemed surprised at my amazement.
As nearly as I could determine he must
have completely disassociated the metabolic Owre
sitting on the bench in front of the rest house,
drinking warm <i lang="ja">ramune</i>, and the Owre of practical
America. Perhaps the Japanese believe in
the “unfathomable mystery of the American
mind.”</p>
<p>We had six hours through the hills ahead of us
if we were to keep on that night to Minakuchi.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Our mentor had told us that one of the most
luxurious of all the country inns in Japan was sequestered
there. To hurry to any particular
place was against our code, but this time it seemed
reasonable to make an honourable exception.</p>
<p>The sun went down behind the paddy fields.
The muddy waters of the terraces caught the
gleaming yellows and reds, but our backs were
against this suffusion of colour. Into the darkness
ahead the narrow road led on and on. Says
the essayist: “The artist should know hunger and
want.” But surely not the art patron. He cannot
perform his function of appreciation unless
comfortably removed from immediate pangs. If
I were to be an enthusiast over that wonderful
sunset—as O-Owre-san persisted in suggesting—I
needed food. It had been fifteen hours since our
cold breakfast and I thought of the inn with an
ardency of vision.</p>
<p>When we did see the town it sprang up
abruptly out of the fields. All along the streets
the lights were shining through the paper walls.
We made inquiry for the <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#yado-ya" id="a-yado-ya" class="pginternal">yado-ya</a></i> and in a moment
were surrounded by volunteer guides. They
are always diverting, the Japanese children, running
along on their wooden clogs and looking up
into your face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>
<p>Maids without number came running to the
entrance of that aristocratic inn, and dropped to
their knees. They bowed until their glossy black
hair touched the ground. The auguries all appeared
auspicious. Then came the mistress.
There were many polite words, but no one took
our rucksacks and no one invited us in. Every
second’s waiting for the bath and dinner was very,
very long.</p>
<p>My Japanese of twelve years before had been
but a few words. Days on the Trans-Siberian
of grammar and dictionary study had not even
brought back that little, but now suddenly I began
to understand what the mistress of that inn
was saying. I had no vanity in my understanding.
The understanding was that we were not wanted.
I had been tired and I had been hungry when
we reached the door, but now I knew the unutterable
weariness of smelling a dinner which
may not be eaten.</p>
<p>The crowd was amused, but it showed its
amusement considerately and with restraint.
Nevertheless two <i lang="ja">seiyo-jins</i> had lost face. Apparently
the mistress did not wish such suspicious-looking
foreigners, grimy, dustless, and coatless,
to remain even in the same town. She called two
’rickshas. She named the next village. She had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
this much magnanimity that she purposed giving
us the chance of orderly retreat.</p>
<p>I tried to continue smiling with dignity and affability.
It is somewhat of a strain on diplomatic
smiles when the subject of discussion is vitally
concerned with one’s own starvation. Nevertheless
I did smile. I explained that whatever we
did we were not going on to the next town. I
knew the word for “another,” and the word for
“inn,” and how to say, “Is it?” And thus I
asked: “Another inn here, is it?” There was
little incitement to believe that she understood except
that her mouth pouted ever so slightly as if
in surprise that I should imply that the mistress
of such a superior inn could have any knowledge
concerning mere bourgeois caravansaries.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san, during this parleying, had put on
his coat and in other subtle ways had transformed
himself into a conventional foreigner. After that
he had settled into repose and silence. I looked at
him. I searched for a flaw. I declared by the
great Tokaido itself that with such a fright-producing
handicap as his ultra-Occidental beard
we should never find resting spots outside the local
jails.</p>
<p>“Humph!” said he. “Stop talking for a minute
and put on your coat.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>I succumbed. “All right, then,” I said.
“Here’s for the magic of that vestment of respectability.”</p>
<p>I sat down on the ground and untied the bag.
The prophecy of magic was too feeble by far
for the prestidigitation which followed. I shook
out the folds of the garment which is called a coat,
a mere two sleeves, a back and a front and a few
buttons. The circle came closer. But it was not
the coat after all which caused our audience so
graciously to begin giving back our lost faces to
us—it was the supermagic of one leg of a pair of
silk pajamas. A black-eyed jackdaw, a trifle
more daring in her curiosity than the others, discovered
the hem of that garment tipping out from
a corner of my pack. She gave it a jerk, and
then another. Next she looked up with coaxing
persuasion, suggesting encouragement to tug
again.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san had insisted that I have those
pajamas made in Kyoto. He has theories about
the necessity of silk pajamas. I never, even remotely,
followed the dialectics of his reasons,
but I must add to the credit side of such theorizings
that pajamas are a most intriguing garment
to pass around for the benefit of an inn courtyard
crowd. The maid gave the next tug and out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
they came. Everybody reached forward a finger
and a thumb to feel.</p>
<p>Between the time of the discovery of the silk
pajamas and their repacking—I cold-heartedly
refused to exhibit a putting of them on—we rose
from nobodies to persons of importance in Minakuchi.
Even the mistress hinted that she had mentally
recounted her space for guests and had
thought of a luxurious corner of amply sufficient
dimensions to spread two beds. There was, of
course, no sane reason why we should not, then
and there, have taken advantage of this altered
atmosphere, but for me the inn had lost its savour.
Anyone who has ever had some similar twist of
psychology will appreciate the inside of my irrationalism.
Others will not or cannot. I moved
over to the ’rickshas. O-Owre-san remained lingering.
He, too, had noted the change in the mistress’s
attitude.</p>
<p>“How about making one more overture?” he
suggested.</p>
<p>“Perhaps so,” I answered, “but don’t you feel
that any experience which this inn might now hold
for us would be an anti-climax after our present
dramatic triumph?”</p>
<p>O-Owre-san regretfully sniffed the fragrant
steam drifting from the kitchen braziers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>
<p>“No, I decidedly don’t feel so,” said he, “but
of course, if I have to save your dilettante soul
from anti-climaxes, I suppose I can sleep in a rice
field—but whatever you do, do it!”</p>
<p>I threw our bags into the ’rickshas and we
climbed in after them, and were off to the other
inn.</p>
<p>We made our impact against this objective
much more catapultic. There was nothing tentative
in our kicking off our shoes and getting well
under the lintel before any mistress of authority
could appear. Our onslaught paralysed the advance
line of receiving maidens, and we settled
down on the interior mats and assumed a contemplative
calm. We continued to sit thus oblivious
to the excitement heaped upon excitement. We
were islands of fact in the midst of an ocean of
conversation. After the ocean had dried up
because none had words left, we were still obviously
remaining, and there was nothing left to
do but to make the best of us. A maid picked up
our bags and bowed very low. She retreated
toward the inner darkness and we followed, first
along a corridor and then up a flight of railless
stairs to a room open on two sides against a courtyard
garden.</p>
<p>To have been in harmony at all with the ancient<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
traditions of the Tokaido, coolies should have
been carrying our luggage in huge red and gold
lacquered chests. The room to which we were
taken would have been a room of dignity even
for a <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#daimyo" id="a-daimyo" class="pginternal">daimyo</a></i>. The maid placed our two dusty
Occidental rucksacks on the shelf under the <i lang="ja">kakemona</i>.
Their very presence piped a chanty that
our possessing that room was ironic comedy. We
began to laugh. A <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#ne-san" id="a-ne-san" class="pginternal">ne-san</a></i> is as ever ready to
laugh as water is to flow, and with no other
grand cause than just the doing. Our maid began
laughing with us, and up the stairs came all the
other maids in curiosity. Ensconced, their interest
seemed permanent. Our vocabulary was very
far from being sufficient to protect our Western
prudery. As a last resort we took them by their
shoulders and turned them around and urged
them in this unsubtle manner from the door.</p>
<p>I began undressing at one end of the room,
leaving my garments in my wake as I rolled over
the soft matting. When I reached the <i lang="ja">kakemona</i>
shelf, I slipped into my silk pajamas. When we
went below to find the honourable bath we at least
left the room looking not so bare as our meagre
luggage had predicted.</p>
<p>We returned from the bath and banked our
cushions on the narrow balcony overhanging the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
garden. A slight breeze stirred the branches
of the trees and started swinging the paper lanterns
which hung over a stone fountain. Other
guests of the inn had finished their dinners
and it was their toothbrush hour. Dressed in
their cotton <i lang="ja">kimonos</i> they stood bending over shining
brass basins filled from the well fountain. It
would probably be useless to ask any Occidental
to imagine that the function of teeth cleansing
with long, flexible handled brushes may be a
social and picturesque addendum to garden life;
we have too long looked upon ablutions as being
merely necessitous.</p>
<p>Dinner came. Whether strict philosophical
truth lies in the belief that every sensation is
unique, or whether in the contrary that no experience
can be other than a repetition of some situation
which has been staged over and over again
in the turning of the cosmic wheel, I shall continue
to maintain that a wanderer who has gone
from half after four in the morning, fortified
only by a mouthful of cold breakfast, until nine
at night, and has walked something more than
twenty-five miles under a hot sun, and has had
one dinner snatched away from him, and then
finds himself risen from a bath and sitting in the
slow, warm, evening air in a room of simple harmony,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and then a small lacquer table is placed
before him with the alluring odours of five steaming
dishes ascending to his nose—yes, I shall
continue to maintain that such a wanderer has a
human right to protest that such a situation is
an event.</p>
<p>They replenished the tables with second supplies
of the first dishes and with first and second dishes
of new courses. We had two kinds of soup and
three varieties of fish; we had chicken and we
had vegetables and boiled seaweed; and we finished
with innumerable bowls of rice. At the
end they brought iced water and tea and renewed
the charcoal in the braziers for our smoking.
The tobacco clouds drifted from our lips. Only
one possible thought was worth putting into words
and that was the request to have the beds laid.
However, the evening was destined not for such
sensuous oblivion.</p>
<p>Breaking in upon this godly languor came a
visitation by the entire family of the inn. The
family particularly embraced in its intimacy also
the maid-servants and the men-servants. Even
the baby had been wakened to come. In the beginning
O-Owre-san offered cigarettes in lieu of
conversation and I thumbed the dictionary for
compliments for the baby. The blue-bound book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of phrases proved to be rich in fitting adjectives,
and my efforts were rewarded with sufficient approval
to encourage us to go on with a search
for compliments for mother and father and all the
others. The baby crawled forward inch by inch
until one of the strange foreign giants courageously
picked it up. Our guests had first sat in a
very formal half-circle, but under the expansiveness
of growing goodwill the line was breaking.</p>
<p>It was a night, however, of many visitations.
Hardly had we, as hosts, with the aid of the baby,
carried the attack with some success against rigid
self-consciousness when there came the sound of
a step on the stair. Immediately the mood of
laughter changed to one of marked quietness
and expectancy. The circle readjusted itself.
The mother snatched back the baby and by some
technic ended its expressions of curiosity and reduced
it, as only a Japanese baby can be reduced,
to a pair of staring eyes. We sat waiting the
coming of the intruder. The <i lang="ja">ne-sans</i> bowed their
heads to the floor.</p>
<p>The awaited one was a tall young man, with
round, pinkish, glistening limbs, and a round face.
He dropped heavily to his knees and bent over
until his forehead touched the mat, continuing this
salutation for some time. Then he sat up smiling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
and satisfied. He had brought with him
three or four foreign books and he was, without
need of introduction, the village scholar, Minakuchi’s
representative of modernity, a precious and
honoured cabinet of wisdom newly come home
from the University. After his smiling expansion
he next composed his features to solemnity. He
adjusted his <i lang="ja">kimono</i> taut over his knees. Then
he waited until the last quiver in his audience
succumbed into the extreme quietude of painful
tension. Even the breeze lulled. He spoke:</p>
<p>“I—am—in—this—room!”</p>
<p>The heads of the circle nodded and renodded
to each other. What had the foreigners to answer
to that?</p>
<p>We tried to express a proper appreciation.</p>
<p>“It—is—cold—to-day—but—it—was—raining—yesterday.”</p>
<p>An opinion about temperature is more or less a
personal judgment, but the falling of raindrops
is a material fact. On the yesterday it had not
rained.</p>
<p>This time the circle could not restrain itself but
sighed with positive and audible contentment. Minakuchi
had been vindicated. If the audience
showed content with its spokesman, it was as nothing
compared to his own contentment. The artist<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in tongues now opened his books with a business-like
air and put on his spectacles. His visit was
not, then, purely social. The sentences which
followed were, as nearly as we could determine,
questions to us. They came, a word at a time,
out of his dictionary. The conventions of speech
which the Japanese employ in polite inquiry have
been moulded by symbolism, mysticism, and analogy
into phrases most remote from the original
rudiment. A word by word translation into English
carries no meaning whatsoever. We answered
by: “Oh, yes, yes,—of course.”</p>
<p>The baby was growing restless. The scholar
took in this sign from the corner of his eye. His
dramatic sense was keen. He had no intention
that his audience should become bored and he
snapped shut the books with the pronounced
meaning that everything had been settled as far
as he was concerned. Then he clapped his hands
loudly. Instantly from below came more footsteps
and a clank-clanking of metal on wood, and
in a moment into the room walked an officer of the
police. His heavy dress uniform was white, with
gold braid twisting round and about the sleeves
and shoulders. His sword, the secret of the rhythmic
clanking, was almost as tall as himself. He
faced us rigidly and without a smile, then slowly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
sank to his knees and dropped his head to the mat.
I have faith that that man, without an extra heart-beat,
would have joined a sure death charge across
a battlefield, but his present duty brought the
red blush of painful embarrassment to his olive
skin from the edge of his tight collar to the fringe
of his black hair. He was silently and perspiringly
suffering in the cause of duty—but what
was his duty?</p>
<p>I do not know just how we gained the idea, if
it were not through telepathy, but we decided that
he was discounting the abilities of the interpreter
down to an extreme minimum, although he listened
attentively enough to some long statement.
After the explanation, which seemingly concerned
us, the youth arose and with much dignity withdrew
from the room followed by many expressions
of appreciation from the inn family. Every
one of us who had been left behind, except the
baby who had gone to sleep, now waited for some
continuance of the drama, but nothing proceeded
to materialize. I grew so sleepy that if the policeman
had suddenly said that we were to be
executed at sunrise the most interesting part of
the information would have been the finding out
whether we could sleep until that hour. As I
did not know how polite it might be to say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<em>we</em> were tired, I found a phrase, “<em>You</em> must be
very tired,” to which I linked, “therefore <em>we</em> shall
go to bed.”</p>
<p>This veiled ultimatum was as graciously accepted
as if they had been waiting those exact
words to free them to go their way. The <i lang="ja">ne-sans</i>
ran for mattresses and prepared the beds. Then
they hung the great mosquito netting. After that
we all said our good-nights, all except the police
official who, image like, remained sitting against
the wall.</p>
<p>By earnest beseeching we had persuaded the
maids not to close the wooden <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#shogi" id="a-shogi" class="pginternal">shogi</a></i> around the
balcony. Thus, when we turned out the lamp and
stretched out on our beds, the starlight came in.
It shone on the white uniform. I had never happened
to have the experience of going to sleep
under the eye of a policeman but realism proved
that practice was unnecessary. Sinking to oblivion
was as positive as a plunge. The vast embracing
fluid of rest closed in over my head.</p>
<p>I was dreamless until I awoke under a sudden,
crushing nightmare. I thought that an army of
white and gold uniforms had mobilized and was
tramping over my chest, taking care that every
heel should fall pitilessly. The one policeman who
existed in reality had been trying to wake me up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and he had evidently had a task, but as soon as
he was sure that my eyes were open to stay he
forwent further assault. He had lighted the lamp
and I could see back of him a naked coolie, convulsively
gasping for breath. The man was carrying
an envelope. The officer took the envelope
and then sent him off. He reeled to the stairs
holding his panting sides. The officer then took
out a sheet of paper and handed it to me. The
page was written in modified English but was quite
intelligible. While the sentences were nothing
more than a series of questions, at the same time
they gave a clue to the mystery of the evening.</p>
<p>Our inn-keeper had had the inspiration to call
upon the scholar-interpreter to ask us the questions
which all travellers must answer for the police
record in every town where a stop is made for the
night. We had been correct about there being one
doubter in Minakuchi of the ability of the interpreter.
In a plot for his own amusement the police
officer had sent a runner to a neighbouring
town to have the conventional list of questions
translated into English, and thus to compare our
written answers with the answers given him by
the youth. There they were, the questions: who
were we—how old—profession—antecedents
whence and whither. If one is tempted into wayward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
rebellion against such minuteness of interrogation,
it is wise to remember that the claim
of a sense of humour may be considered very
poor testimony in a Japanese court perchance
misunderstandings at any time arise and the
answers in the police records have to be
looked up.</p>
<p>I wrote out the answers. With no one in the
room as a witness except ourselves, the officer
allowed a twinkle to come into his eye. He even
winked and pointed to where the youth had sat.
Then he shut up the paper in his register and
blew out the light and clanked off down the stairs.
Again we slept.</p>
<p>The etiquette of an inn is that all crude appearance
of hurry should be avoided by waiting
in one’s room in the morning for one’s bill. The
Japanese do not travel hurriedly; if they wish
an early start they get up proportionately in
time. We had asked for an early breakfast and
it had been served at the hour which we had
named. We had happened to have good intentions
about not rushing. Nevertheless, of course,
we fell into an inevitable hurry. After breakfast
I had been so interested in sitting on our balcony
watching the waking up of the day that I forgot
to pack my rucksack. O-Owre-san said that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
would pay the bill downstairs and wait at the
door.</p>
<p>When I arrived under the lintel where we
had left our shoes I felt as if I were intruding.
The bearded foreigner was surrounded by the
inn family and each member was handing him a
present. There were blue and white Japanese
towels folded into decorated envelopes, and there
were fans and postcards. The cost of the gift
fans may have been little but the maker had taken
his designs from models of the best tradition,
and the fans to be found for sale are not comparable.</p>
<p>The daughters of the house walked with us
until we came to the Tokaido and then they
pointed out our direction and stood waving farewells
until we could see them no longer. I waited
until then before making inquiry about the
amount of the bill. This detail was a matter of
distinct importance. When we met in Kyoto
we pooled our purses and the common fund was
entrusted to O-Owre-san’s care. Neither of us
had made much effort to acquire theoretical information
about what daily expenses might be.
We had just so much paint with which to cover
the surface of the definite number of days before
our steamer would carry us away, and this meant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
that we would have to mix thick or thin accordingly.
Experience only could teach us what items
we could afford and what bargains we should have
to make. I thus awaited the answer about the
bill with flattering attention.</p>
<p>“The bill, including extras for iced water and
cigarettes and getting our special dinner after
every one else had finished,” said the treasurer with
appropriate solemnity, “was three <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#yen" id="a-yen" class="pginternal">yen</a></i>.” (A <i lang="ja">yen</i>
is about fifty cents.) “And,” he concluded, “I
gave a full <i lang="ja">yen</i> for the tea-money tip.”</p>
<p>We waited until we sat down for the first rest
before we attempted a practical financial forecast.
We divided the number of remaining days
into the sum of the paper notes carried in a linen
envelope. The answer quieted our fears and exceeded
our hopes. Putting aside a reserve for
extra occasions, beyond our inn bills we would
be able to afford the luxury of spending along
the road twenty-five cents a day for tea, tobacco,
and chemical lemonade.</p>

</div>
<p>There is something unnatural in such simplicity
of finance, as anyone must agree who believes at
all in the jealousy of the gods. I should have
been forewarned by an old Chinese tale that I
had been told only a fortnight before. It was
while sitting in a Peking restaurant. The teller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was a most revolutionary son of a most conservative
mandarin. A peasant once entertained a god
unawares. In the morning the god told the peasant
that any wish which he might name would
be granted, be it for riches, or power, or even
the most beautiful maid in all the dragon kingdom
to be his wife. But the peasant asked that
he might only be assured that until the end of
his days he need never doubt when hungry that
he would have food, and at the fall of night that
he would find a pillow on which to lay his head.
The god looked at him sorrowfully and said:
“Alas! You have asked the impossible. Such
favours are reserved for the gods alone.”</p>
<p>We got up from our figuring blithely, indulging
ourselves in the idea that we could achieve
such evenness of expenditure. Think what an
upsetting of ponderous economics and competitive
jungle law there would be if the world could
and should abruptly take any such consideration
of its wealth!</p>
<p>The payer of the bill had also added that he
had given a full <i lang="ja">yen</i> for the tea-money tip. In
those large areas of Japan where the barbarous
foreigner has not yet intruded with his indiscriminate
giving, there is to be found the ancient
system of tea-money. The tea-money custom is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
founded on the belief that the wayfarer is the
personal guest of the host. When the guest
departs he is not paying a bill, he is making a
present, and to this sum he adds from a quarter
to a third part extra. This extra payment is
the tea-money and is to be divided by the host
among the servants. The departing guest is then
given a present. All in all, leave taking is a
function.</p>
<p>A guest does not ask nor demand. He offers
a request and thereby confers a supreme favour
upon any servant fortunate enough to be designated.
All this pleasant service has not the embarrassment
that one must confine a request to
any particular maid so as to escape the necessity
of widespread tipping at departure. It is all
in the tea-money.</p>

<div id="I_HAVE_EATEN_OF_THE_FURNACE_OF_HADES">
<h2>III<br>
<span class="titlefont">“I HAVE EATEN OF THE FURNACE OF HADES”</span></h2>
<p class="center" style="margin-left:9em; margin-top:-1em; margin-bottom:1.5em">Vol. I, Sect. IX. The “Ko-Ji-Ki”</p>
<p>A very famous book in Japan is named the
“Ko-Ji-Ki,” and the word means “A Record
of Ancient Matters.” We thought on our second
morning as we walked through the hills that if
there should happen to be a modern chronologist
recording a present-time Ko-Ji-Ki those
hours of the sun’s approaching meridian would
be entered without dispute as The-Forever-Famous-Never-To-Be-Equalled-Day-Of-Fire.
In
the valleys there was no breeze; on the summits
there was no shade; and everywhere it seemed
probable that on the next instant the road would
blister into molten heat bubbles under our feet.
However—to anticipate—if such a postulated
chronicler had so styled that second day of our
walking as one without chance of peer among
historical days of heat, on the very next following
day he would have had to turn back to cross
out his lines. In the burning glare of the rice
fields, anything that had gone before was so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
easily surpassed that we forever lost belief in
maximums, unless indeed kinetic energy might
continue on such a wild rampage of vibration
that it would shake itself completely out of
existence.</p>
<p>Our first rest of the second day, as I said,
was devoted to the arithmetic of finance. At
that early hour the dew was not yet off the
grass, but when we began planning for another
rest the world had grown parched. Looking
about for some possible spot we saw through
the trees the roof of a small temple. We halted
at the entrance and tried to push open the gate.
It would not move. It was nailed to the ribs
of the fence, but the gate was low enough to be
vaulted. Our feet fell on the ghost of a path
that had once led to the shrine. Harsh brambles
and weeds had fought for the possession of the
path until they had almost conquered the flaggings.
If we thought at all we thought that
that particular walk must have been abandoned
for some other entrance and as the scratches
were not very serious we pushed our way through
until at last we stepped forth into the temple
yard. Not a sign of caretaking devotion was
anywhere in evidence nor was there a nodding
priest sitting in the temple door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>
<p>Sometimes the Chinese desert their temples
but, when incense is no longer burned before an
altar, celestial practical sense leaves little that is
movable behind. We slowly walked up the
steps to the door, expecting to find the temple
rifled. The door was sealed by spiders’ webs.
We then walked around the balcony and peered
through the wide cracks in the <i lang="ja">shogi</i>. No fingers
of man had rummaged there since the priests
had said the last mass, but the fingers of decay
had been busily working. The rotted fabrics
hung down from the altars of the shrines and
the ashes of the incense in the bronze bowls was
hidden by the blacker dust which the wind had
carried through the shutters. Surely we were
the first intruders to step upon the balcony since
the gate had been swung to and nailed.</p>
<p>We walked around the corners until we had
seen everything that there was to see and then
we jumped down to a grassy slope on the shady
side of the temple and stretched ourselves out
in relaxation. It was very quiet. As I knew
O-Owre-san could sleep for ten minutes and
then wake up to the instant, I closed one eye
and then the other. They both came open together.
I had felt a soft dragging across my
ankles and I raised my head to see a very thin,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
long, green and grey snake raising its head up
between my feet to stare into my face. After
a beady inspection it wriggled away with slow
undulations into the grass. And then, from the
spot where that snake had taken passage over
my ankles, came the head of another. I jerked
my feet up under me.</p>
<p>The instant before there had been an oppressive
quietness. The silence had been so supreme that
we ourselves had scarcely spoken. Now there
was a vast hurrying of little noises. Lizards
ran along the rafters under the roof and dropped
down the wall, as lizards do, to flatten themselves
away into corners. Huge buzzing flies rose from
the surface of the pond and bumped against us
aimlessly. Mosquitoes came from the shadows.
I had thrown my helmet on the grass. I picked
it up to find it beset with ants. I tried to beat
them out of the lining by pounding the hat
against the side of the temple. The effort broke
loose a roach infested board.</p>
<p>We grinned at each other a little shamefacedly
when we were safely out into the sunshine of the
highroad. We had not stayed to argue in the
temple yard. As we stood thus vanquished and
ejected, two peasants came passing by. They
looked at us, then glanced hurriedly at the temple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
roof above the low trees, and then eyed us again.
They mumbled a word or two. Perhaps they
were trying to tell us that an accursed goblin
had stolen over their shrine to be the abode of
insects and crawling things. I was not so sure
that I had not seen the glowing eyes of a goblin
staring malevolently at us from the cracks of
the <i lang="ja">shogi</i> when I turned to look back over my
shoulder as we fled.</p>
<p>For a long way my blood welcomed the sun.
The road led down into a broad valley to become
later little more than an interminable bridge
across the terraced paddy fields. The rice had
sprouted but had not grown rank enough to
block the mirror surface of the water from throwing
back the heat rays. Ahead were low-lying
hills with higher slopes beyond and from the map
we thought that over that barrier would be the
broad plain across which we would find the road
leading straight to Nagoya.</p>
<p>There was one ambition to luxury which we
always possessed—when we chose a rest spot we
wished one of comfort and, if it could be included,
also that it should have a view. Curiously,
owners of land do not seem to endeavour to
provide such rest places for sensitive travellers,
at least to be obtrusive at any exact second when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
desired. We had taken seven or eight miles
across the valley at an unusually accelerated pace
since our last attempt at a rest. Messages from
the cords of our legs were telling us to concede
some compromise to our particularity. However,
we continued walking and searching without paying
attention to the messages. The grass patches
always disclosed little ant hills upon close inspection
and the occasional heaps of stones to be
found were never under the shade. That obstinacy
of ours was of the stuff ambition should be,
and finally its persistency met due reward. We
found a wide, shady platform built against a
long building, half house, half granary. The
building flanked the road at a bend and as we
made the turn we could see the family of the
house lying on the floor. An old man was telling
an elaborate story and his listeners were so
intent upon the tale that none of them happened
to look up to see us. The platform was
out of their vision and we thought that we
might rest there with the comfortable feeling
that trespassing does not exist unless discovered.</p>
<p>The tale that was being told was undoubtedly
humorous. The daughters of the family were
hard struggling with laughter. The men were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
emphasizing their approval by pounding on the
rim of the charcoal brazier with their iron pipes.
All were repeating a continuous <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#hei" id="a-hei" class="pginternal">hei</a></i>, <i lang="ja">hei</i>. But
there was a baby, and the baby was not so much
interested in the story as he was in a butterfly.
He suddenly betook himself to his dimpled legs
and circled into the road in pursuit. The whims
of the gyrations of the mighty hunter carried
him to a spot where the next turn left him facing
two foreigners on the platform. He stood with
feet apart and carefully lifted the corner of his
diminutive shirt to his mouth for more careful
cogitation, as any Japanese child should and
does do when confronted by a kink in the well-ordered
running of affairs.</p>
<p>The mother called out an admonition but there
was no response from the <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#akambo" id="a-akambo" class="pginternal">akambo</a></i>. She left the
story to find out what might be the enchantment.
She, too, began staring without responding to
admonitions. Another head bobbed around the
corner post and then another and another until
finally the teller of the tale himself forsook the
realm of fancy for fact and followed after his
audience. We said “<i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#o-hayo" id="a-o-hayo" class="pginternal">O-hayo</a>!</i>”—which is good-morning—and
they said “<i lang="ja">O-hayo!</i>” After that
their rigid attention included everything from
our hats to our boots. Then in a body they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
walked back into the house and were quiet except
for the most hushed of whispers.</p>
<p>“Two trespassing strangers are about to receive
some mark of respect,” said O-Owre-san.</p>
<p>“Respect of being told to move on, most
likely,” was my more worldly judgment.</p>
<p>“How about betting a foreign dinner to be
paid in Yokohama before the boat sails?” asked
O-Owre-san.</p>
<p>I took the wager, and lost.</p>
<p>The old man who had been the teller of the
story now reappeared. He was somewhat embarrassed
but at each step of his approach he
had a still broader smile. He was short and
he was thin, with lean, knotted muscles. His
limbs had grown clumsy from heavy toil.
His face was squat as if in his malleable infancy
some evil hand had pressed his forehead down
against his chin. One piece of cloth saved him
from nudity. He was a coolie of generations
of coolies, but despite his embarrassment and
despite his clumsy limbs, the very spirit of graciousness
created a certain grace as he placed
a tray before us. He backed away with low
bow succeeding low bow. The tray held a pot
of tea and two cups and some thin rice cakes.</p>
<p>Good man, he fortunately never knew what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
an argument his gift precipitated! My opponent
began it all by suggesting that we leave a
twenty <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#sen" id="a-sen" class="pginternal">sen</a></i> silver piece on the tray. I disputed.</p>
<p>“A cup of tea is of such slight cost to the
giver,” was my eloquent and disputatious argument,
“that by being of no price it becomes
priceless and thus is a perfect symbol of a complete
gift in an imperfect world. Japan has this
tradition which we have lost in our own civilization.
This simplicity allows the poorest and
humblest to give a gift to the richest and
mightiest in the purity of hospitality. If we
leave money on the tray we are robbing the
peasant of his privilege.”</p>
<p>O-Owre-san would have none of my transcendentalism.
“By leaving money,” said he, “a sum
which means no more to us than does the cup
of tea to the peasant, we are making an exchange
of gifts. We know that he is very poor. Twenty
<i lang="ja">sen</i> is probably more than the return for two
days of his labour. It will buy him a pair of
wooden <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#geta" id="a-geta" class="pginternal">geta</a></i> or a new pipe, or a bamboo umbrella
for his wife, or such a toy for the baby as it
has never dreamed of. After giving our gift
we shall disappear down the road, leaving the
memory of two ugly but generous foreign devils.”</p>
<p>There was no dispute between us about wishing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to leave some gift. The final compromise
was somewhat on my side as we gave a package
of chocolate to the child. We carried the chocolate
for emergency’s sake and it had cost several
times twenty <i lang="ja">sen</i>. I do not believe that Japanese
children like chocolate and there was more than
a possibility that this highly condensed brand
would make the baby ill. Surely the deposed
gods of the ancient Tokaido must have made
merry if the news of our analytics was carried
to their Valhalla. Nevertheless our present,
wrapped in a square of white paper according
to the etiquette of gifts, was received by the
family with as many protestations of appreciation
as if we had handed them a deed to perpetual
prosperity.</p>
<p>The rays of the forenoon’s sun when we were
crossing the valley of the rice fields had sent up
heat waves from the dust of the road until the
road itself seemed to me to have a quaking pitch
and roll. We were now in the full glory of the
noontide. I was becoming somewhat disturbed
over certain phenomena. Trees and rocks and
houses fell into the dance of the heat waves with
an undignified stagger. Sometimes the bushy
trees reeled away in twos and threes where but
a moment before I had seen but one. The most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
disconcerting part of the development was my
peculiar impersonal interest and study of my
own distress. I knew that my eyes were aching
and I knew that the trees were really standing
still. I had the perfect duality of being fascinated
by the day and thus not wishing to be
any place else in the world and yet, as I said,
of being extremely disturbed by the preliminary
overtures of a sunstroke. We had had about
two hours of climbing since we left the house
of the rice farmer and we were on the summit
of the last high hills. Immediately ahead the
rocky path dropped sharply down into the plain.
A rest-house marked the point where the climbing
changed to the descent. I suggested a halt.</p>
<p>The rest-house was more than a peasant’s hut.
It was easy to believe that in more aristocratic
days it had been an inn of some pretension.
Now it was a spot for weary coolies to throw
down their heavy packs for a few minutes’ rest
in its shade by day or by night to curl up on
the worn mats. We walked into the deepest
recess of the entrance before we sat down. I
could look beyond a half-folded screen into the
kitchen. The polished copper pots and the iron
and bronze bowls were not of this generation;
probably to-morrow’s will find them on a museum<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
shelf or cherished in some antique shop. However,
I had no desire to discover curios nor did
I have any preference whether the inn was old
or new, nor whether it had been its fortune to
entertain <i lang="ja">daimyos</i> or pariahs. We first asked
for something to drink. The hostess dragged
up a bucket from the well and brought us bottles
of <i lang="ja">ramune</i> which had been cooling in the depths.
I drank the carbonated stuff and then pushed
my rucksack back along the mat for a pillow
and closed my eyes for a half-hour’s blissful
forgetfulness. When I awoke the throbbing
under my eyelids had passed away and for the
first time I really looked at our hostess. She
was kneeling beside us and was slowly fanning
our faces.</p>
<p>Her teeth were painted black, as was once the
fashion for married women. She had known both
toil and poverty, but it was not a peasant’s face
into which I looked. Her thin fingers and
wasted forearms found repose in the lines which
the ancient artists were wont to copy from the
grace of Old Japan. Her calm face was
beautiful.</p>
<p>It was time that we should make our way
down the rocky path. She brought us tea before
we went. The bill for everything, as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
remember, was about seven cents. We left a
silver coin beside the teapot. She began to tell
us that we had made a mistake. We told her no.
Shielded by an unworldly, intangible delicacy,
I doubt whether any rudeness of her guests ever
became sufficiently real to her to disturb her
passivity or her emotions, but such a guardianship
presents a thin callous against sympathy.
As we said good-bye a sudden sense of human
mutuality smote the three of us, an experience
of sheer bridging-over intuition which sometimes
comes for a second.</p>
<p>The absolute relaxation had so marvellously
driven out the devils from my eyes that I did
not even tell O-Owre-san of my hallucinations.
To make up for our lingering we pushed on
through the villages without stopping to wander
into temple grounds or to explore by-ways.
Between a misreckoning of miles on our part
and some misinformation which I gathered from
a peasant, we reached the rather large town of
Siki an hour earlier than we had hoped. As we
strolled through the main street, we saw several
inns which might well have given us comfortable
shelter, but I sensed that the traveller at my side
was waiting for some bubbling of inspiration.
I kept silent, an expiation for having carried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
a disproportionate number of points that day.
We continued walking. I could see the fringe
of the first rice field ahead. My faith was beginning
to waver but before I erred by showing it
O-Owre-san stopped abruptly and inquired the
Japanese word for inn. He then asked for one
or two other words and adjectives. Thus armed
he stepped into a shop, the appearance of which
had perhaps been the stimulus to his inspiration.</p>
<p>The shop had glass windows and a glass door.
It was the most metropolitan example of commercial
progressiveness which we had seen since
we left Kyoto. In fact, compared to the other
shops of Siki it had as haughty an exclusiveness
as any portal along New Bond Street seeks to
maintain over possible rivals. Looking through
the glass of the door we discovered that the floor
was not covered with matting. Such a last touch
of foreignism meant that one could walk in without
taking off one’s dusty boots. I do not remember
that we ever again found this detail of
Western culture outside the port cities. In the
heart of the most isolated mountain range the
most lonesome charcoal burner knows three
things about the foreigner: that he is hairy like
the red fox; that he has a curious and barbarous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
custom known as kissing; that his boots are part
of his feet.</p>
<p>Into this shop, then, O-Owre-san walked without
having to undo his bootlaces. There was
also an aristocratic glass counter and under the
glass, in show trays, were gold watches. Behind
this counter sat a young man in a <i lang="ja">kimono</i> of black
silk. His face was pale, ascetic, and contemplative.
He smiled and bowed in formal hospitality.
The grace of such a bow comes from centuries
of saying <em>yes</em> instead of <em>no</em>. A cultured Japanese,
almost any Japanese, never flatly contradicts
unless to deny another’s self-derogatory statement.
The <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#iiye" id="a-iiye" class="pginternal">iiye</a></i> (used as “no”) is rarely heard
and the carrying over of the omnibus <i lang="ja">hei</i>, <i lang="ja">hei</i>, or
the more polite <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#sayo" id="a-sayo" class="pginternal">sayo</a></i>, into the English <em>yes</em> often
brings consternation to the Westerner seeking
accurate information.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san said, “Please, good inn” (directly
translated). As if the pale and ascetic seller
of gold watches was accustomed daily to having
perspiring foreigners with packs on their backs
inquire for this information, he bowed again and
smiled and said, “<i lang="ja">Hei</i>, <i lang="ja">hei!</i>” This time the <i lang="ja">hei</i>,
<i lang="ja">hei</i> did mean yes. He drew his <i lang="ja">kimono</i> tighter
about his hips and adjusted his silken <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#obi" id="a-obi" class="pginternal">obi</a></i>, and
walked out of the shop with us. Apologizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
for the necessity of going before, he piloted us
through turns of the street to the gateway of
an inn. Calling for the mistress he made a
dignified oration of introduction, and backed
away from our sight with innumerable appreciations
for the honour of being asked to be of
service.</p>

<h2>IV<br>
<span class="titlefont">THE MILES OF THE RICE PLAINS</span></h2>
<p>The experiences of the second of our Japanese
Nights’ Entertainments were as impersonal, as
far as the inn’s paying special attention to us
was concerned, as the first evening’s had not
been. The police record was brought to us with
an English translation of the questions and we
wrote the answers without complication. The
incidents which may develop in one inn quite
naturally have a wide variation from the happenings
which may arise in another, but the general
machinery of hospitality differs but little. There
is, in fact, far less contrast in the essentials of
comfort between the ordinary provincial inn and
the native hotels of the first order in Tokyo or
Kyoto than there is to be found in a like comparison
of hotels in our civilization; even it might
be said that the simple and fundamental artistry
of the shelter which houses the peasant in Japan
has in its possession the root forms of the taste
which charms in the homes of the cultured.</p>
<p>Immediately after we had applied ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
to the police record and had had our steaming
hot bath, a <i lang="ja">ne-san</i> brought the small dinner tables.
If ever this particular maid had enjoyed the
frivolity of laughter for laughter’s sake, she had
long since banished any such promotion of irresponsible
dimples from the corners of her mouth,
although it should be stated that she was far
from having arrived at an age to provoke a solemn
and serious outlook upon life. Her eyes
wandered up to the ceiling and around the edges.
She was bored. Furthermore she appeared distressed
at having to witness the table errors of
ignorant foreigners. We insulted the honourable
rice by heaping sugar upon it and we drank
cold water when we should have sipped tea. We
asked for a few extras to the menu. She repeated
over our words, caught in amazement
that we could change the barking sounds through
which we found communication with each other
into the music of <i lang="ja">Nihon</i> speech. We asked if
she were not afraid of barbarous foreigners, but
she rather contemptuously rejoined that she could
see no reason for being afraid in the shelter of
her own inn. I then concocted from the dictionary
an elaborate sentence which asked whether
her expectation of how fearsome a foreigner might
be was excelled by the examples in flesh and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
blood before her. The truth of her obvious conviction
and the sense of required politeness of
hospitality struggled each for utterance with such
disconcerting effect that she used her turned-in
toes to patter away down the flight of stairs and
we saw our disapprover not again until she came
to spread the beds.</p>
<p>We had planned to explore the shops of Siki
by lantern light after dinner but the two beds
so aggressively allured us that we never stepped
over them. The coverings were the usual heavy
quilts buttoned into sheets. Such a combination
coverlet is generally long enough for the foreign
sleeper as the Japanese habit on cold nights is
to disappear completely under the layer, but at
the inn in Siki for some reason the length was
decidedly curtailed and the mattresses were correspondingly
short. However, at the end of such
a day of fire as we had had I was contemptuous
of such limitations. I expected to sleep on the
quilt and not under it.</p>
<p>For an hour, covered only by my cotton
<i lang="ja">kimono</i>, I knew the comfort of airy rest. Then
I awoke to a sensation I had almost forgotten.
I was chilled through. I entered upon a campaign
of trying to get back to sleep by wrapping
the abbreviated quilt about my shoulders. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
far from satisfactory result was that my legs
were left dangling in the chill drafts while the
protected upper surfaces melted. Next I essayed
a system of sliding the quilt up and down, executing
retreats from too copious perspiration.
This procedure met with some success but the
required watchfulness was hardly a soporific. I
called myself a tenderfoot. Some slight appreciation
of how ridiculous it all was destroyed any
high tragedy of self-sympathy but it could not
keep me from loathing O-Owre-san for breathing
so tranquilly. Finally I got up, determined to
force my ingenuity to find some balance between
such excesses. Then I saw that O-Owre-san’s
eyes were wide open.</p>
<p>I know not what the temperature of that room
was in actual Fahrenheit degrees, but too many
truth-tellers have secretly confided to me that they
have found just such uncanny nights in Japan
to disbelieve that the midnight “Hour of the
Rat” has not at times a malignancy independent
of mere thermometer readings. That night was
neither cold nor hot; it was both and it was both
at the same instant. My skin had been flushed
to a mild fever from its long bath in the sun’s
rays, but the flesh beneath now grew iced when
not swaddled beneath the furnace of the quilt.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
My inspiration, after sitting for a time and
studying all the possible materials in the room,
was to build a tent. I was so successful that
I hurled a defiance at the “Hour of the Rat,”
and for another half-hour—perhaps it was—I
again knew the positiveness of sleep.</p>
<p>The Japanese believe that they are a silent
people. That faith is one of the supreme misbeliefs
of the world. Before dinner, when we
were sitting on our narrow balcony, we had said
good-evening to a circle of young men who were
lounging on cushions in the large room next to
ours. Later they dressed and went out and we
forgot them. I awoke to hear through the thin
wall that they had returned. They were holding
a Japanese conversation. Such a conversation
can only be described by telling what it is not.
In rhythm it is neither the cæsura of the French
peasant woman retailing gossip, nor is it the
eluding tempo-harmonic tune of the Red Indian
drum beat; it is not the Chinese intoning nor
is it a staccato. At first the foreign ear does
not distinguish the beat of the cadences but once
captured the appreciation of the subtle metrical
wave is never again lost. We had the opportunity
of full orientation that night. The paper
wall was but a second tympan to our ears.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>Their conversation as an entity was a musical
composition effected without counterpoint and
played by the instruments in succession. First
there was a swing of phrases from one speaker,
and then after a decorous and proper dramatic
pause there was an answering swing from another.
No speaker was interrupted. The right
of reply was passed about as if it were as physically
tangible as a loving cup.</p>
<p>There was one distinct suggestion from the
monotony of it all above every other impression,
a something absolutely alien to any Occidental
conversation. While they talked and drank tea
and drank tea and talked, I twisted about under
my tent puzzled to solve what that impression
was. Suddenly I found words to express to myself
the sought-for revelation. The effect of a
long Japanese conversation is that of <em>voiceful
contemplation</em>. Separated from them physically
only by a paper wall, we belonged to another
world, a world which has ordered its existence
without finding contemplation and its manifestations
a necessary adjunct.</p>
<p>The mosquitoes, which all night had kept up
a noisy circling over our net, flew off at daybreak.
Some speaker spoke the concluding word
in the next room and for a few minutes the universe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
was quiet. Then came the high shrieking
of the ungreased axles of coolie carts being
dragged to the rice fields. I took my quilt and
cushions out onto the balcony. The inn began
waking up. Down in the garden two kitchen
maids appeared. They were arousing their energy
by dipping their faces into brass basins of
cold well water. I left my balcony and wandered
below to find a basin for myself.</p>
<p>The inn had filled during the night with guests
of all descriptions and ranks. They were coming
forth from under their quilts. A <i lang="ja">ne-san</i> stepped
to the wellside and filled a basin for me and then
ran off to find a gift toothbrush. Another maid,
lazily binding on her <i lang="ja">obi</i>, stayed her dressing for
a moment to pour cool water from a wooden
dipper over my head and neck. Getting up o’
the morning is a social cooperation in a Japanese
inn.</p>
<p>Breakfast came. After breakfast I sat down
on the balcony cushions to smoke and to breathe
the delicious morning air and I promptly went
to sleep. I wished to go on sleeping forever and
to let the world work, or walk, or talk, or do
anything it might choose to do, but O-Owre-san
appeared, saying that he had paid the bill. He
had stuffed our presents into his rucksacks and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
had had the dramatic farewells to himself. After
one has accepted a going-away present, one goes.
Tense good-byes do not brook recapture. The
super-wanderer is thus forbidden ever to retrace
his steps. For him alone, his life being always
the anticipation of the next note of the magic
flute, does the present become real by eternally
existing as a becoming. He will not pay the
price for contentment, which is to re-live and rethink
the past.</p>
<p>When we at length reached Nagoya, where
the government bureau records temperatures
scientifically, we learned that the week had been
really one of extraordinary heat. Among other
symptoms of the week, deranged livers and
prickly irritation had inspired angry letters in
the readers’ columns of the foreign newspapers,
belabouring everything native, particularly the
casual discarding of clothing. A newspaper
editor told us that such attacks of hyper-sensitiveness
over nudity come not to foreigners newly
arrived nor to those residents who sanely take
long vacations back to their homelands (where
they may have the rejuvenation of themselves
being homogeneous with the masses), but to the
conscientious unfortunates who remain too long
at their posts. Round and about them for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
twenty-four hours of the day and the seven days
of the week surges the sea of native life. The
feeling of lonesome strangeness, which can never
be entirely lost by the foreigner, feeds on its own
black moods and this poisonous diet suddenly
nourishes a dull hatred. Then come the bitter
letters to the press demanding that the Japanese
reform themselves into Utopian perfection and
threatening that unless they so do the foreign
guests of the empire will assemble in convention
and design an all-enveloping bag (with a drawing
string to be pulled tight about the neck of
the wearer) as a national costume for their hosts
for evermore.</p>
<p>If hot days in the port cities, where there is
some mild regulation of costume, can bring such
disturbances of mind to anxiously missioning folk,
we thought that it was as well that they were not
walking with us that day through the villages of
the broad plain which slopes from Mount Keisoku
to Ise Bay. It was before we were out of
the hills that our road carried us through a grove.
A stone-flagged walk led into the shadows of
the trees and we could see at its end the beginning
of a long flight of stone steps which bespoke
some hidden and ancient shrine beyond. A small
stream flowed alongside the path and cut our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
road under an arched stone bridge. We heard
shouts of laughter from the pines and the next
moment an avalanche of children came tumbling
along as fast as their legs could take them.
Some were cupids with bright coloured <i lang="ja">kimonos</i>
streaming from their shoulders; some did not
have even that restraint. A tall, slender maiden
was in pursuit, and the pursuit was part of some
game. They dashed by us through the light and
shadow and were lost again in the pines.</p>
<p>It was the reincarnation of a Greek relief. In
that flash of the moment in which we saw them,
the glistening nude body of the pursuing girl
running through the green and brown and grey
of the grove was passionately and superbly the
plea of nature against man’s crucifying purity
upon the cross of sophistication.</p>
<p>I regretted to O-Owre-san the having within
me so much of that very sophistication that I
had begun immediately to moralize upon such
a sheerly beautiful vision. He, who had been
saying nothing, replied with an end-all to the
subject. “Your mild regret,” said he, “that
dispassionate analysis has displaced passionate
creativeness is the penalty you pay for the pleasure
of studying your own sadness.”</p>
<p>The Greeks, I believe, had for one of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
two axioms by which they covered the conduct of
wise living, “No excess in anything.” I had
very fearlessly compared the young girl to a
Greek relief, but when we were out of the hills
and were in the meaner villages of the plains
I began to feel the truth of that Greek dictum
that people can mix too much practice into a
theory, especially when it comes to an overwhelming
surrender to naturalness. I lost my enthusiasm
for my so shortly before uttered panegyric
of a world naturally and unconsciously
nude. I began to understand a new meaning
in the artist’s cry of “Give me Naples and her
rags!” Especially the rags! Upon some occasions
art and sensibility need the rags far more
than does morality.</p>
<p>All this argument was with myself as O-Owre-san’s
dismissal of my tentative first offering on
the subject had not been encouraging to further
communication. I then proceeded to a further
step in my private debate and queried whether
in the selection of clothes, to be truly practical,
man would not be served better by trusting to
comfort rather than to either art or morality;
and then I came upon the thought that comfort
has no strength to resist convention when they
collide, and as convention, with the guile of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
serpent, always makes much pretension of riding
in the same omnibus with virtue, perhaps after
all the true wisdom of life is to stay close to
convention and thus one will be pretty sure to
reach Journey’s End in good shape. I mentioned
my change of heart to O-Owre-san as we
were sitting down in the shade of a <i lang="ja">ramune</i> shop,
where unabashed nudity had gathered in a circle
to regard the foreigners. He did not seem to
be moved to interest by my reformation. I
heaped a malediction on his head. Surely if
I were willing to rearrange my opinions seven
times daily at some one stage he might agree.</p>
<p>It was during this rest that I came upon the
happiest adventure that the mouth of man may
hope to experience in this imperfect world. I
had been thirsty from that first day in the East
when I had begun breathing in Manchurian
dust. In Peking I had tried to cool my throat
by every variety of drink offered through the
mingling of Occidental and Oriental civilizations.
In Korea, a certain twenty-four hours of wandering
alone and lost among the baked and arid
mountains had further augmented the parching
of my tongue—an increasement which I had believed
to be impossible. Along the Tokaido we
were free to drink as much chemical lemonade<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
as our purse could buy and, despite the warnings
of all red-bound guide books, we drank the water.
But never, since the beginning of my thirst, had
I found a liquid worth one word’s praise as a
quencher, neither water nor wine, neither <i lang="ja">ramune</i>
nor tea. I have irreverently forgotten the name
of the village of the discovery.</p>
<p>As we sat resting in the <i lang="ja">ramune</i> shop I looked
about and saw some champagne cider bottles of
unusually large size. The quantity rather than
the flavour of that particular chemical combination
was the appeal. I asked for two of the
bottles, making the request to a maid who was
hoisting a flag over the door. The flag had a
single Chinese character printed on it. It was
a sign which I later learned to distinguish from
incredible distances. After flinging out the flag,
she took down two bottles from the shelf but
instead of opening them she smiled with a beaming
which came from the secure faith that she
was bearing good news.</p>
<p>“<i lang="ja">Kori wa ikago desu?</i>” she asked.</p>
<p>The concluding three words are among the
first to be learned from the phrase book and mean
“Do you wish?” The word <i lang="ja">kori</i> I remembered
from its having been one of the extras of our
first night. It means “ice.” We said yes, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
we would like ice, but in our ignorance we spoke
with no marked ebulliency. She smiled again
and sat down, folding her arms in her <i lang="ja">kimono</i>
sleeves, an equivalent of that expression of contented
virtue shown when our own housewives
peacefully wrap their hands in their aprons.</p>

<div class="caption" id="ebm_caption3"><p class="center">THE KORI (ICE) FLAG OF THE “ADVENTURER”</p></div>
</div>
<p>That the flag above the door had some definite
meaning for the villagers began to be most evident.
The shop was filling. Mob expectancy is
contagious and we found ourselves waiting tensely
with no clear idea what we were waiting for.
The shop was now quite full and all eyes were
turned to the street. We heard shouts from the
outside that were almost <i lang="ja">banzais</i>, and a coolie
came running in. His face was aflame from the
happy look of completed service. He was carrying
a dripping block of ice in many wrappings
of brown hemp cloth. I do not know how far
he had come with the ice. Perhaps he had been
to some station of the distant railroad. The
maid took her hands from her <i lang="ja">kimono</i> sleeves
and seized the ice. She pulled off the wrappings.
Next she took a saw and cut off an end from the
cake. Another maid re-wrapped the precious
remainder in the hemp cloth and buried it in a
pit dug in the floor. A third maid had been
standing by with a board which had a sharp knife<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
edge set into it. The first maid scraped the end
of the ice cake over this inverted plane and
shavings of sparkling snow fell into her hand.
She packed this whiteness into two large, flat,
glass dishes. She poured into the snow the effervescing
champagne cider and brought us the
“adventure.”</p>
<p>An adventure is an adventure in proportion
to the emotion aroused. For days without end
thirst had been sitting astride my tongue. Just
as the Old Man of the Sea fastened his thighs
around Sindbad’s neck and then kicked the poor
man’s ribs mercilessly with his heels, so had my
parasite tickled my throat with his toes. To have
unthroned my tormentor at the beginning of his
companionship would have been a sensuous satisfaction.
To do so after having known the abysses
of abject slavery was an ecstasy exceeding the
dreams of lovers.</p>
<p>I flushed the ice particles around in my mouth
until my eyes rolled in my head. O-Owre-san
was alarmed into protests. I had no time to
listen. I ordered another bowl of snow and another
bottle. It was costing <i lang="ja">sen</i> after <i lang="ja">sen</i> but
I knew in my soul that if I had to beg my rice
to get to Yokohama and had to sleep under
temple steps, even if the price for the snow thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
beggared me, the uttermost payment could be in
no proportion to the value.</p>
<p>The fertile plain through which the Tokaido
now wound was crowded with the sight of man.
A few houses always clustered wherever a rise
in the ground could lift them above the water of
the rice fields. The paddy toilers, digging with
their hands around the rice roots, worked in long
lines, men and women, with their bodies bent flat
down from their hips against their legs. If they
noticed our passing and looked up, we would say,
“It is hot!” and they would say, “It is hot!”
Finally an avenue of scrub pines brought shade
and I declared for a siesta. Our first attempt
gave way before a horde of ants. We tried relaying
the top stones of a heap of boulders and
then climbed up on that edifice, going to sleep
quite contentedly. When I yawned into wakefulness
I looked lazily around the landscape
wondering where I was. I felt queerly and
strangely alone. It was not that the sound of
breathing from under O-Owre-san’s helmet had
ceased. He had not become a deserter, but while
we were sleeping every peasant in the fields had
disappeared. There can be, then, a degree of
heat under which a coolie will not labour, and
we had found the day of that heat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>In the next village we discovered our labourers
again. They were lying on the floors of their
open-sided houses, the elders motionless except
for the deep rising and falling of their breasts
and an arm lifted now and then in desultory
fanning. The children, however, were restless
enough to be startled into gazing at the two
strangers who were walking the gauntlet of the
narrow street.</p>
<p>We had seen an ice flag over a shop at the
very entrance to the town but O-Owre-san suggested
that there would surely be another shop
farther along. I accepted his reasoning but there
was not another <i lang="ja">kori</i> flag to be found anywhere.
We had reached the last house. The sign over
the shop we had passed was at least a mile back
along that burning white cañon. O-Owre-san
stopped in at the last house to beg some well
water. I looked at the water and thought of
the ice.</p>
<p>“If there ever was any ice back there,” said
he, “it’s melted by this time.”</p>
<p>I was venomous. I left my luggage and
started back.</p>
<p>The children, maybe, had been telling their
parents of the sight that they had missed, a sight
which might never come again. The grinding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of my heels this time brought a somewhat larger
audience to their elbows. They appeared appreciative
of my second appearance. I staggered
on and on, mopping my head with a blue and
white gift towel. I felt in my limbs the exact
strength that would carry me to that <i lang="ja">kori</i> shop,
but to have had to go a foot beyond might well
have meant an experience in hallucinations which
I had no wish to know.</p>
<p>An old man, who grinned toothlessly, dug
down into a sawdust pit and exhumed a fair-sized
cake of ice. He moved about his work
grotesquely as if he were an animated conceit
of carved ivory quickened into life for a moment
by the hyper-heat. He at last gave me a bowl
of snow with sprinkled sugared water over it.
I munched the ice for a full half-hour. As I
slowly grew cooler the crowd about me slowly
grew larger. They stood silently staring, always
staring.</p>
<p>The change for the silver piece which I put
down was a heap of coppers. It must have weighed
half a pound or more. I might not have been
so generous if the wealth had been more portable.
As it was, I invited in two or three boys from
the circle of the crowd. A carpenter’s apprentice
had been sitting on the bench beside me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
He had paid for one bowl of snow which he had
held close to his lips, tossing the sugar powdered
ambrosia into his mouth with dexterous flips of
a tiny tin spoon. He looked at the ice supply
about to disappear into the pit and I invited
him to a further participation. He glanced at
me intensely for a second as if he wished to solve
by that one glance every reason for my existence.
Then he turned his attention to his second bowl,
which I paid for. His hair was clipped close to
his skull. The fresh, youthfully transparent skin
of his face was stretched like a sheet of rubber,
the tension holding down his nose and allowing
his eyes to stare with an openness impossible to
optics otherwise socketed.</p>
<p>Just how the round, cannonball head of the
Japanese boy evolutes into the featured physiognomy
of the Japanese man is puzzling. It must
be a sort of bursting. The schoolboy’s eyes betray
the passing moods of his emotions, but there
is always something beyond the mood of the
moment in his gazing, an intangible yearning for
infinity. It must at times be terrifying for an
Anglo-Saxon teacher or missionary to face those
eyes. Such a victim may find respite by swearing
in the court of all that is practical and material
that the mere physical strangeness of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
deep staring has bewitched him. He is wise if,
by clinging to analysis of the objective world,
he can restrain all passion to disturb such mysteries—otherwise
he may be led into a voyage
such as that of Urashima to the enchanted island.
And then, if ever he seeks to return to his Western
identity, he may find that the world which
he once knew has died and that he stands neither
wedded to the daughter of the Dragon King nor
possessing the substance of his former self.</p>
<p>I was thus dreamily communing, studying the
face of the carpenter’s apprentice. It was he
who recalled me from such heat born, mental
wanderings by finishing his ice, picking up his
<i lang="ja">kimono</i> and throwing it over his shoulder, and
walking off with the air of, “Well, you ice
dreamer, I have been with you for a moment,
but now I have work to do in the world.” I
followed after him and walked out again into
the fiery street.</p>
<p>I can swear that the ice had cooled me back
to the normal. I felt myself a part of the obvious
world. I had banished the disease known as the
imagination. I was doing the most practical
thing for the moment, going back to my rucksack.
But I can also swear that the real world was
most unfairly unreal. Great-grandfathers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
great-great-grandmothers, who had passed so
far along on their journey through life that probably
they had given up hope of ever again seeing
anything new and worldly strange to interest
them, had been carried to the fronts of the houses
to behold the outlander. It was as if I had not
come to see Japan but Japan had been waiting
long and patiently to see me, a parading manikin
in a linen suit and yellow boots and a pith helmet.
The naked, old, old women, their ribs slowly
moving under their dried skin as if breathing
and staring were their last hold upon the temporal
world, knelt, supported by their children, on the
mats. Walking slowly by I felt that I was the
sacrificial pageant of the ceremony for their final
surrender. There was not a sound from their
lips. I began to have a sense of remarkable
completeness, that I was a single figure with no
possible replica. It was not until I saw O-Owre-san’s
blue shirt that I was able to snap the thread
which was leading me not out of but into the
tortuous labyrinth of such speculative folly.</p>
<p>“I was just going back to look for you,” said
he, “I thought you must have had a sunstroke.”</p>
<p>It seemed just then an unnecessary and a too
complicated endeavour to explain the minute difference
between standing with one’s toes on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
edge of the calamity which he had feared for me
and the actuality of toppling over the precipice.
Thus I merely replied that I was feeling all
right.</p>
<p>Some tribes of men have in their dogma that
the beard must never be trimmed. I am able to
imagine that O-Owre-san would carry a sympathetic
understanding always with him, no matter
among what races he might go adventuring, except
into the society of the disbelievers in beard
trimming. He demands an extreme exactitude
in the trimming of his own beard which proclaims
the existence of a certain precise flair of idealism.
This flair may be seen manifested in him also
in such croppings out as his appreciation for
flawless cloisonné. The fact that he had discovered
a barber shop and had not made immediate
use of his find was overwhelming proof that
he had been really solicitous about me. Now
that I had returned he made no further delay
but sat down in the chair. I stretched out on
the matting to wait. The barber’s daughter
brought cushions and placed them under my head
and then knelt at my shoulder to send scurrying
breaths of cool air from her fan across my
face.</p>
<p>When I awoke O-Owre-san was paying the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
barber’s charge. It amounted, if I remember,
to three <i lang="ja">sen</i>, or perhaps three and one-half <i lang="ja">sen</i>.
Whatever it was the now properly trimmed
<i lang="ja">kebukei</i> foreigner left four <i lang="ja">sen</i> and one-half from
his honourable purse, and there was another copper
or two as thanks to O-Momo-san for the
gentle medicine of her fan.</p>
<p>The barber’s clippers, which he had used with
such art, had perhaps cost four <i lang="ja">yen</i>. If so, they
would—as may be determined by simple division—require
at least one hundred similar payments
before the return to the barber of their initial
cost; and there were the razors, and the chair,
and the shining cups and bottles, all representing
capital outlay; and there must have been rent
to pay. There are three demi-gods of the East
and only under their reign lies the answer. Great
is rice, that it satisfies the hunger. Great is cotton,
that it clothes the limbs. Great is art, that
it can build the home from the simple bamboo.
The barber jingled the four <i lang="ja">sen</i> and a half between
his palms, and the jingle was the music
that sings of the buying of the rice, the cotton,
and the bamboo. There is mystery and magic
in economics; and there is, in the submission of
man to recognize money as a medium of exchange
and in his cooperating to maintain that recognition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
by law and force, the greatest story in the
world.</p>
<p>The barber ceased jingling the coins and
dropped them into a drawer. His daughter remained
kneeling, her wistful, gentle head bowed
low in good-byes. She had been silent but I
imagined that I knew two of her thoughts—no,
I should say, two of her moods. One was quite
obvious. She had been amused (it was an adventure
in its way) to fan to sleep a foreign
guest. But the other mood, born of dreaming,
was asking where the road led, which those
strange visitors were striking out upon, stretching
away into the distance as does the march into
the beyond of life.</p>
<p>We were talking idly one day with a maid
in a certain inn. Her name was O-Kimi-san,
and she was pretty in the flush of youth, and
“very pretty anyhow,” as O-Owre-san critically
observed. Her feet were quick as sunshine when
she ran for our dinner trays, or to bring tea
instantly to our room upon our coming in from
the street, or to fetch glowing charcoal to our
elbow if we should wish to smoke, and her fingers
were cunning in all the other little luxuries of
service. She was saving money, she said, for
the wedding which might be, but as she had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
neither father nor mother to arrange a marriage
she added quite simply that she was only hoping
to be married. She desired to wed a merchant,
with a shop of his own, having a little room
upstairs over the bazaar so that the good wife
might be able to run down and attend to customers
between domestic duties. She declared
an antique shop would be the best, for one can
buy nowadays from the wholesalers such wonderful,
not-to-be-detected imitations. But her
eyes grew sad. It was not within reason to hope
that a merchant with such a shop would ever
love a dowerless girl, and it was taking so long
to save the capital herself. Why, one of the
maids of the inn had been there sixteen years!
If she had only three hundred <i lang="ja">yen</i> the heaven
upon earth might be hers.</p>
<p>I know that O-Momo-san, the daughter of the
barber, when she sat wondering what lay beyond
the farthest distance she could see along the road,
was not imagining a little shop, where between
domestic cares she could take time to wait upon
customers.</p>
<p>It is for the imagination of dreaming O-Momo-san
that the priests light the incense at the sacred
altar; it is for practical O-Kimi-san that they
read the traditional advice from the theology of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
moral maxims. The Marys and the Marthas!
The cherry blossoms are a bloom of mysterious
beauty for the daughter of the barber; they are
a symbol of gay festival time for the practical
maid of the inn. Will it be the end for the
daughter of the barber of Kasada to marry her
father’s apprentice and to live on in the little
shop, dreaming until dreams slumber and are
forgotten, knowing only this of the old Tokaido
that it leads away in a straight line until it is
lost in the brilliant blur of the sun on the waters
of the rice fields? Or will her imagining heart
know adventure in the world beyond the vision
of her doorstep? Perhaps the <i lang="ja">sen</i> will come so
slowly to the barber’s drawer that the wistful
daughter will be sold to a <i lang="ja">geisha</i> master, and in
filial piety, fulfilling the contract, she may go
even to Tokyo where she will be taught to sing
and to dance and to laugh gaily. She may find
that life is kind. Again, she may be sold to
another life—under the juggernaut of poverty—and
in the Nightless City knowledge will come
to dwell in the empty place where wistfulness
was.</p>
<p>We walked away from Kasada along the unchanging
road; one blade of rice was like another,
one step was like another, finally one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
thought became like another. Nagoya was many
miles ahead. O-Owre-san, the tramper, is of the
faith which holds that to give in to a stretch of
road just because it is dull is to surrender for
no reason at all. That is good doctrine. I have
something of it, but my hold upon the faith is
admixed with a Catholicism which does not preclude
the restful and inward harmony of maintaining
speaking acquaintance with several conflicting
beliefs. On the other hand O-Owre-san
will, simply and unostentatiously, subordinate his
preferences, but the surrender is so generous that
that virtue is usually a protection in itself against
applied selfishness. To escape any disagreeable
feeling of shame I thought it might be that
O-Owre-san could be induced to make the suggestion
himself that we take some more rapid
means of transportation. We were in the land
of <i lang="ja">jiu-jitsu</i>. The fundamental idea of this system
is that you politely assist your opponent to throw
himself. I began by alluding to the thrills and
possibilities of the antique shops of Nagoya. If
we should continue walking we could not reach
there until late at night, and if we should find
Kenjiro Hori waiting for us and prepared to be
off early the next morning, when would there
be time for exploring? I then ventured casually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
that the railroad would take us to Nagoya in a
couple of hours. Imagination began to work as
my ally. O-Owre-san at last queried directly
whether I would be willing to give up walking
in the country for exploration in the city. I
yielded. Thus, when the arrogant Tokaido of
steel crossed our road, as the map had told me
it soon would, two foreigners with rucksacks
found places amid teapots and babies, bundles
and ever fanning elders, and soon they saw the
tall smokestacks of modern Nagoya.</p>
<p>Our kit of clean linen and clean suits had been
forwarded from Kyoto in care of the foreign
hotel. Perhaps we each had had the idea when
the bag was packed that we would be exceedingly
content to catch up with it again, not alone
for the contents but in anticipation that the finding
would mean that we would be again surrounded
by the comfort of Western standards
exotically flourishing. Alas for the stability of
our tenet! We were aware that our capitulation
to the simplicity of the native inns sprang partly
from the glamour of the new, but the conquest
had come from realization and not mere anticipation.
Dilettantes we were, truly, and as such
we acknowledged ourselves, but we should be
credited that we escaped the eczema of reformers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
We had no obsession to hasten back to our own
land to argue the multitudes out of the custom
of wearing shoes in the house or sitting on chairs
instead of floors. Nevertheless when we walked
into the door of the hotel and up the stairs every
tread of our heavy, dusty boots struck at our
sensibility of a better fitness and order.</p>
<p>We walked along the upstairs hall and passed
a room with wide open double doors. There
was Kenjiro Hori waiting for us; that is, a
semblance of O-Hori-san was there, his material
body. When a Japanese sleeps his absorption
by his dream hours is so complete that one is
tempted to believe that his so-called waking hours
(no matter how manifested in energy) may be
only a hazy interim between periods of a much
more important psychic existence. We walked
into the room and sat down and talked things
over and waited for the opening of Hori’s eyelids,
but they moved not. O-Owre-san at last
departed to seek treasure trove in the antique
shops and I decided for the laziness of a bath.</p>
<p>I asked for a hot bath. The bath boy’s uniform
was starched and new, and he was starched
and new in his position as drawer of water. He
was very proud of such responsibility and was
very earnest and very smiling. In some other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
occupation he had picked up a little English.
He promised to hurry. Minutes went by. Above
the sound of the running of the water I could
hear a mysterious pounding and scraping. This
combination of noises continued with no regard
for passing time. Now and again I pounded
on the door in Occidental impatience. “Very
quick! Very quick!” would come his answer.
When the bolt did snap back I could see from
his perspiring face that he must have been hurrying
after some fashion of his own. He bowed
and pointed to the tub. I put in one foot—and
out it came. The water might have come from
a glacier.</p>
<p>“I asked for a hot bath—<i lang="ja">o yu, furo</i>,” I shouted.</p>
<p>There was no retreat of the smiles. They
even grew.</p>
<p>“Japanese man, he take hot bath. Foreign
man, he take cold bath.”</p>
<p>I now understood the scraping and pounding.
The hot days had attacked the water tanks of
the hotel until the faucets marked “Cold” were
running warm. The bath boy had been laboriously
stirring around a cake of ice in the tub.
Blandly came the repetition, “Foreign man, he
take cold bath.”</p>
<p>For the sake of sweet courtesy and kindly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
appreciation I should have sat down in that
water, but I did not. I pulled out the stopper
and drew a hot tub. When the boy realized this
sacrilege against the custom of the foreign man,
he veritably trembled from the violence of the
restraint which he had to put upon himself, but
his idea of courtesy was so far superior to mine
that he retreated. I bolted the door against him.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san returned from his field with enraptured
accounts. There is some sort of affinity
between him and a bit of treasure. He is the
hazel wand and the antique is the hidden water,
but as a human divining rod he does not merely
bend to magnetism, he leaps. My first initiation
to that knowledge had been so sufficiently
striking that no new evidences ever surprised me.
That initiation had come when we were riding
one Sunday morning on the top of a tram in the
cathedral city of Bath. We were in the midst
of a discussion. Half way through a sentence
he suddenly lifted himself over the rail and disappeared
down the side of the car. When I
could finally alight more conventionally I ran
back to find him with his nose against a dull
and uninviting window. From the top of the
tram he had seen within the shadows a chair.
There was no arousing the antique shop on Sunday<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
and thus he left a note of inquiry under the
door and eventually that particular treasure,
wrapped in burlap, made its long journey to
America.</p>
<p>He began discussing the treasures of Nagoya
when in walked Hori.</p>
<p>“I don’t see how you got by my door,” said he.</p>
<p>“Weren’t you asleep?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, just dozing,” he explained.</p>

<h2>V<br>
<span class="titlefont">THE ANCIENT NAKESCENDO</span></h2>
<p>We had an hour to kill before dinner and we
were irritably moody against the foreign windows
which gave us no breeze. “It’s housely
hot,” said O-Owre-san, and he sighed pathetically
for the cool mats of an inn floor where there
would be a pot of freshly brewed tea at his elbow
and a green garden to look out upon. I was
studying a map of Japan, tracing out its rivers
and mountains.</p>
<p>I have an inordinate passion for maps. Surely
Stevenson had some such passion. I venture
that he first thought of the pirate’s chart of
“Treasure Island” and after that first imagination
the story simply wrote itself. Particularly
does passion find satisfaction in one of the old
Elizabethan maps, printed in full, rich colours,
the margins portraying the waves of the sea with
dolphins diving, and with barques straining under
bellied sails. Some are headed for the Spanish
Main, and others are striking out for the regions
marked “Unknown.” Those old Elizabethan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
maps could have been drawn only in the days
of hurly-burly England when the deep-chested
seamen under Raleigh and Drake sang savage
sea songs in the taverns and the tingling life in
a man’s veins was worth its weight in adventure.
No wonder that to-day, with our pale, lithographed
maps telling us the exact number of
nautical miles to the farthest coral island we have
become analytic and scientific. As Okakura said,
“We are modern, which means that we are old.”
Nevertheless, a pale, errorless, unemotional map
is better than no map at all.</p>
<p>The particular map of Japan which I was
studying had had a few mysteries added in the
printing which were not to be blamed upon the
geographer. The different colours had been laid
on by the printer with marked independence of
registration. It was difficult to trace even the
old Tokaido, but imagination from practical experience
told me that when it followed the coast
it led through miles and miles of rice fields.
Farther up on the map, in the mountain ranges
above Nagoya, I saw a blurred word and turning
the sheet on end I read “Nakescendo.”</p>
<p>The word brought a remembrance. I began
trying to piece together what that memory was.
At last I assembled a forgotten picture of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Japanese whom I had once met on a train. In
the beginning I had thought him a modern of
the moderns until he told me of his sacred pilgrimages.
It was my surprise, I suppose, in his
tale of his tramping, staff in hand, with the
peasants that had made me so distinctly remember
his earnestness as he mouthed the full word
“Nakescendo.” I rolled over on the bed with
my finger on the map and asked Hori if he had
ever heard of the Nakescendo.</p>
<p>Hori looked up in surprise as if I had rudely
mentioned some holy name. “All day,” said he,
“I have been thinking of the Nakescendo.” Then
he told us how the Nakescendo road enters the
mountains through the valley of the beautiful
Kiso river and, following the ranges first to the
north and then to the east, takes its way to
Tokyo. In the era before railroads it was a
great arterial thoroughfare and in those feudal
days the <i lang="ja">daimyos</i> of the north and their retainers
journeyed the Nakescendo route with as much
pomp as did their southern rivals along the
Tokaido. Nevertheless the Nakescendo now
exists in history as the less famous thoroughfare
of the two. Hori suggested that the dimming
of its fame may have come because its ancient
followers had cherished its beauty with such intensity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
that they did not allow their artists to
paint it nor their poets to sing of it to the world,
in the belief, perhaps, that all objective praise
could be but supererogation.</p>
<p>I had most of this imagining from Hori’s
understatements rather than from anything definite
that he said. He is of the <i lang="ja">samurai</i> and his
ancestors learned the art of conversation in a
court circle devoted to the graces. The incompleted
phrase of the East so subtly makes one
an accessory in the creation of the idea involved
that we, of the West, who live in a world of
overstatement, find ourselves disarmed to deny.
One cannot discount words that have never been
uttered.</p>
<p>I added to Hori’s words some definite phrases
from my own imagination. These were to influence
O-Owre-san if possible. I knew that it
had been his long held dream to walk the Tokaido
from end to end, but I had not realized until I
saw his dismay at my suggestion of a change
how ardent his dream had been. I had recklessly
prophesied the mountains of the Nakescendo to
be the abode of spring among other praises. It
could not be denied that whatever the Tokaido
was or was not, the rice fields that had to be
crossed would not be springlike.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<p>We slept over such argument as we had had.
The next day burst in the glory of a burning
sun, which was rather an argument on the side
of the mountain faction. The breakfast butter
melted before our eyes. O-Owre-san finished his
marmalade and pushed back his chair, and then
casually capitulated. “Well,” he said, “if we
are going to the mountains, what are we waiting
for?” What indeed? I ran upstairs to our
room and pulled off my hotel-civilization clothes
and stuffed them into the bag and labelled it
for Yokohama. There was to be no more formal
emerging into the <i lang="ja">seiyo-jin’s</i> world for us until
we should reach that port of compulsion.
O-Owre-san was less exuberant in his packing
but he cheerfully whistled some air—which was
indeed forgiving—and as usual was ready before
I was.</p>
<p>Hori’s travelling kit had evidently bothered
him not at all. A half-dozen collars, two or three
books, one or two supplementary garments, and
a straw hat were tied up in a blue and orange
handkerchief and this <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#furoshiki" id="a-furoshiki" class="pginternal">furoshiki</a></i> was tied to the
handlebars of a bicycle. Until we met the bicycle
we had talked of the problems and plans
of the three of us, but from the instant of production
there was no gainsaying that there were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
four of us. Further, the really colourful and
unique personality among the four partners of
the vagabondage was that diabolical, mechanical
contraption.</p>
<p>In making that machine, the manufacturer,
without possibility of dispute, had achieved the
supremacy of turning out the most consistently
jerry-built affair since the beginning of time.
He merits first immortality both in any memorialization
by the shades of jerry-builders who
have gone before and in the future from the
tribe as it expands and multiplies upon the earth.
The loose, and often parting, chain hung from
sprocket wheels that marvellously revolved at
nearly right angles to each other. When Hori
mounted into the saddle the wheels fearsomely
bent under his weight until their circumferences
advanced along the road in ellipses strange and
unknown to the plotting of calculus. The rims
scraped the mudguards in continuous rattle as
if there were not enough other grinding sounds
of despair coming from every gear and bearing.
In some way those abnormalities worked together,
acting in compensation. Any one of the single
errors without such correspondingly outrageous
offset would have been prohibitive to locomotion.</p>
<p>The indomitable spirit of the machine to keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
going should perhaps be praised, but its general
character was steeped in malevolency against all
human kind. It hated Hori no less violently
than it did us or strangers. It hated and was
hated and continued to leave a trail of hatred
in its path until a certain memorable day when
we came to a mountain climb. While we were
discussing what best could be done for its transport
the proud spirit overheard that it would have
to submit to being tied upon a coolie’s back. It
rebelled into heroic suicide at that prospect. It
committed <i lang="ja">hara-kiri</i>. The entire mechanism collapsed
suddenly into an almost unrecognizable
wreck.</p>
<p>“When the flower fades,” says Okakura
Kakuzo, “the master tenderly consigns it to the
river or carefully buries it in the ground. Monuments
are even sometimes erected to their memory.”
Hori gave a piece of money to the coolie
for a reverent burial of the demon wheel.</p>
<p>Our breakfast had really been luncheon and
after our energy of packing and getting started
we so indulged our time in the shops on the
way out of the city that we finally decided that
if we were to get into the mountains before
night we should have to take the train over the
paddy fields. The bicycle, the rucksacks, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
blue and orange handkerchief, together with the
owners, were crowded into an accommodation
train. The small engine puffed with the temperament
of a nervous pomeranian, throwing a volcanic
spume into the air which condensed into a
fine diamond ash to come back to earth and to
stream into the windows and then to drift, eddy,
and scurry about the seats and floor.</p>
<p>An accommodation train has the verve of life
which the conventions of a through express stifle;
but whether it be a New England local with
bird cages, or the Italian <i lang="ja">misti</i> with priests and
snuff boxes, nursing madonnas, garlic sandwiches,
and chianti bottles, or the stifling wooden boxes
of Northern India crowded with Afridi and
Babus, no train in all the world is as domestic
as the Japanese <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#kisha" id="a-kisha" class="pginternal">kisha</a></i>. Friends and the friends
of friends come to rejoice in the dramatic formalities
of farewell. If perchance any individual
on the platform is neither the friend nor the
friend of a friend of some departing one he
takes an altruistic pleasure in smiling upon the
opportunities of others.</p>
<p>We bought our pots of tea with tiny earthenware
cups attached and put them on the floor
as did everyone else; and we also bought our
<i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#bento" id="a-bento" class="pginternal">bento</a></i> boxes, of rice, raw fish, pickles, seaweed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
and bamboo shoots, from the criers of “<i lang="ja">Bento!
Bento!! Bento!!!</i>” The train started. No one
was bored; the children were not restless; and
we of our carriage stayed awake or went to sleep
in every posture possible to the flexibility of
human limbs matched against the rigidity of
wooden seats. The babies came along and became
acquainted and we sent them back to their
parents carrying gifts of cigarettes.</p>
<p>Curled up on the seat across from ours, with
her head resting on her luggage, was a girl about
twenty years of age. She was a Eurasian and
was beautiful rather than pretty. Now and
again her graceful arm raised her fan but otherwise
she did not move. Her dark eyes returned
no curious glances. Her mood of mind and soul
seemed as frozen and hard as the blue ice of a
mountain glacier. It was a passionate negativity,
her defence against the instinct of society,
which eternally wages war upon the hybrid. It
is instinctive, this struggle of the race mass mind
against the disintegration of its integrity. She had
learned the meaning of glances. The Eurasian
must expiate a guiltless guilt. She did not ask for
quarter in the battle; far back of that cold, defensive
gaze was the strength of two proud races.
Character makes fate, said the Greeks. Inevitability<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
may make tragedy. We were to pick up the
threads of old tales of love and tragedy along the
valley of the Kiso, but in the life of that strange,
fearless, beautiful Eurasian girl was the web
and woof of a yet uncompleted story. When
we at last passed our bundles out of the window
at Agematsu she had not stirred.</p>
<p>We had been carried out of the plains and night
was coming down. Hori voiced an inquiry about
our landing spot. It was indeed high time to
be located some place for dinner and the night.
Our indifference to particularization about our
landing had begun to harass him. In Kobe and
Nagoya when our surpassing indefiniteness had
come out he had nodded and said, “yes,” evidently
putting his faith in the belief that there would
surely be an eventual limit to such casualness. I
was slow to realize his worry but when I did some
primitive idea of justice told me that his breaking
into the inefficiency of our methods ought
to be more gentle and gradual. I whispered
this intuition to O-Owre-san and thus, when the
train halted at the next platform, out went our
luggage and we were left standing to watch the
fiery cloud of cinders disappear into the blue-grey
mist.</p>
<p>It had grown cold. The rain was curiously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
like snow, drifting through the air, seemingly
without weight. There was the beginning of a
path up a slippery clay hill, the upper reaches
of which were lost in fog and darkness. Even
the short distances of vision, which until then had
endured, succumbed before we had scrambled
up the hill. We made a careful reconnaissance
with hands and feet and found that the mountain
path at the top branched in several directions.
The town might lie in any direction. For more
meditative cogitation Hori carefully lowered the
bicycle to its side but unfortunately there was
no ground beneath and off it slid. We heard it
painfully scraping down the rocks. In Alpine
fashion we had to go after it. We crawled back
again to stand in a circle on the road, drenched
and mud covered.</p>
<p>Dinner, bed, and bath might be within a hundred
yards but to take the wrong path might
mean to wander until sunrise. At least so we
thought. Such a variety of adventure is much
more interesting in retrospect than prospect.
However, it was worse to stand still. We started
on an exploration, craftily putting the bicycle
next to the precipice. On peaceful days the gears
often meshed in moderate quietness but at any
time when its companions failed in omnipotent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
judgment they would grind out a wailing reiteration
of: “I told you so. I told you so.” We
were shuffling along to the measure of that lamentation
when suddenly there was a sparkle of light
ahead. It was from a lantern. The bearer was
a peasant bundled up in a rush grass cape. He
lifted the light into our faces and then gave a
single sharp cry of fear. Next he shut his eyes
tightly and was speechless.</p>
<p>A well-balanced consideration for the rights
of one’s brothers is intended for normal times.
Now that a guide had offered himself to us out
of the darkness we purposed to keep him, although
for a few minutes he seemed a rather useless
discovery. Hori managed at length to pry
the man’s eyes open with wet fingers and, then
with fair words sought to persuade him that if
we were not ghosts we obviously needed his help,
but that if we were, then any sense left in him
should tell him that it would be far better to
listen to our request to guide us to an inn and
to leave us there than to risk our trailing him
to his own home. He grasped Hori’s point. We
followed after our guide and, as we had suspected,
the distance to the village was only a few
steps. At the threshold of the inn our guide
bolted. If he had been cherishing a grudge he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
should have waited to see our reception. It was
not pleasing to us.</p>
<p>Hori advanced into the courtyard to engage
in Homeric debate. The fog sweeping in struggled
with the lights of the lanterns and candles.
The picture was a theatrical composition. There
were the three rain-soaked, laden intruders facing
the maid-servants. The maids’ <i lang="ja">kimono</i> sleeves
were pinned back to their shoulders and their
skirts were gathered up through their girdles.
Their faces and limbs gleamed in the coppery
light. The door to the steaming kitchen opened
on to the courtyard and within its shadows the
pots and kettles hanging on the walls caught the
glowing flame of the charcoal. I suppose there
was not a more honest inn in all the land but
the wild, picaresque picture suggested an imagining
by Don Quixote painted by Rembrandt or
Hogarth or Goya. It was a point of immediate
reality, however, which concerned us, and that
point was that we were so far in the inn but no
farther, and no farther did we get.</p>
<p>They gave a reason. They said that the inn
was full. It seemed so ridiculous to have had
such trouble in finding an inn and then to lose it
that O-Owre-san and I began laughing. We
laughed inordinately, but our barbarous merriment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
brought our listeners no nearer to changing
their conviction that the inn was full. There
was another inn farther down the street, they
said, and we borrowed a lantern and a coolie
from them and started. The coolie ran ahead
and when we arrived at the second inn the mistress
and all her maid-servants were at the door. From
the length of Hori’s argument I became suspicious
that we again were not considered desirable,
but after a time he turned and said: “It’s all
right.”</p>
<p>As soon as we were in our room, hurriedly getting
ready for the bath, I tried to find out from
Hori what the long debate was about, but English
is evidently much more laconic than Japanese.
He summed it all up by saying that they
feared the inn was unworthy of foreigners. Admirable
<i lang="ja">bushido</i>! What inn in the wide world
could have been worthy of such bedraggled wanderers?
However, once we were allowed within
the walls and recognized as guests the spirit of
hospitality welled solicitously.</p>
<p>Listen, O dogmatists! The joy of the finding
is not always less than the joy of the pursuit.
If there are doubters let them seek the Nakescendo
trail and find the second inn of Agematsu,
there to learn that no dinner that they have ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
imagined can equal the realization they will discover
inside the lacquer bowls and porcelain
dishes which will be brought to them.</p>
<p>The maid who had been assigned to administer
to our comfort accepted her duty as a trust. She
was unbelievably short, but was very sturdy.
Her broad face and the strength of her round,
unshaped limbs proclaimed the hardy bloom of
the peasantry. The physical, mental, and emotional
unity which comes as the heritage of such
unmixed rustic blood is in itself a prepossessing
charm. Our daughter of Mother Earth was as
maternal as she was diminutive. She might think
of a thousand services, her bare feet might start
of an instant across the mats to respond to any
requests, but never did she surrender one iota
of her instinctive belief that we, merely being
men, were only luxurious accessories for the world
to possess. She was so primordially feminine
that she inspired a terrifying thought of the possibility
of society being sometime modelled after
the queendom of the bees.</p>
<p>She had never seen a foreigner but she had
heard much gossip of our strange customs. Her
inquiring mind was intent upon verifying this
gossip as far as possible. She was also very curious
about our possessions. She taught us how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to hold our chopsticks and how to drink our soup.
She told us that we drank too silently. A little
more noise from our lips, she said, would show
that we were appreciating the flavour. She did
acknowledge in us some aptitude to learn, implying
that if a more advanced state of culture had
existed in the feminine family group of our homes
over the seas we might have been mothered into
some respectability. So saying, she arose sturdily
to her full height and bore away the dinner tables.
Then she returned to make the beds, struggling
with the mattresses as might an ant dragging oak
leaves.</p>
<p>When the beds were finally laid she brought a
fresh brewing of tea and replenished the charcoal
in the <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#hibachi" id="a-hibachi" class="pginternal">hibachi</a></i>. She lighted our after dinner
cigarettes for us by pressing them against the
embers. She sat waiting until we had dropped the
last stub into the ashes. Then guardian midget
rolled back the quilts, ordered us to bed, tucked
us in carefully, giving to each impartially a good-night
pat. Her day’s work finished, assuredly
her efforts entitled her to a quiet enjoyment
of one of the cigarettes! She sat down on
the foot of my bed and deeply drawing in the
smoke, blew it into the air with a sigh of contentment.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>
<p>“I have been told,” she said, “that foreigners
marry for love. Can that be true?”</p>
<p>We assured her that that custom existed.</p>
<p>“Um-m-m,” she pondered. Our examination
was evidently of import. She took another step in
questioning.</p>
<p>“But if you married for love how can you be
happy to travel so far away from your wives?”</p>
<p>She gasped at our claim of non-possession.</p>
<p>We made a second insistence regarding our
unsocial state. She did not put aside her good
nature but she berated us roundly for our unkindness,
our lack of taste, in thinking that we
could joke in such a way just because she was
a peasant girl in a country inn, but when we
further insisted upon repeating our tale she was
really hurt. There is a time, she said, for joking
to come to an end. If it were always thus our
custom to insist upon a joke long after it had
been laughed at and appreciated, then she did
not believe that she had excessive pity for our
wives and children in their being left behind
while we wandered.</p>
<p>She then dismissed us from her questioning
and appealed exclusively to Hori. She could understand
that if we had been forced to marry
by parental social regulation and had been united<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
to wives whom we did not and could not love,
perhaps it would be quite within reason that we
should wish to have vacations in singleness, but
to have had the privilege of marrying for love
and then to be wandering alone—oh, it was un-understandable.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Hori mysteriously, “I think that
what they have said is the truth but it may not
be all the truth. In their country certain desperately
wicked criminals are not allowed the privilege
of marrying.”</p>
<p>There is a glamour which hangs over the notoriously
wicked. The maid’s glances were now
modified by appropriate awe into distinct respect.
She got up, and endeavouring for dignity built a
tower out of the scattered cushions. She climbed
upon this shaky height and turned out the light.
Then she hurried away to the backstairs regions
with her tale.</p>
<p>In the morning it was raining. When we got
up we could hear no sounds below and when we
went to the bath there were no maids to fill the
brass basins. Hori wandered off to the kitchen
to find hot water and we did not see him again
until after our maid, very heavy-eyed, had brought
the breakfast tables to our room. He came as
the bearer of two items of information which he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
had gleaned from the mistress. The first was
that there had been a council sitting on our morals,
presided over by our maid, which had lasted
through the hours of the night. The second item
was the truthful reason why we had been turned
away from the first inn and the confirmation of
our suspicions that we had gained admittance
where we were only by an extremely narrow margin.</p>
<p>Once upon a time two foreigners had passed
through Agematsu and had been received as
guests in one of the inns. That advent had been
so many years before that a new generation of
mistresses and maids had succeeded the victims
of the marvellous invasion, but the legend of that
night of terror had been handed down undimmed.
“And what do you think was their unspeakable
atrocity?” Hori asked dramatically. “<em>They made
snowballs from the rice of the rice box at dinner
and threw them at each other and at the maids!</em>”</p>
<p>From time to time, through the mountains,
we heard again the legend of those two remarkable
<i lang="ja">seiyo-jins</i>. We grew to have an admiration
for knaves so lusty in their revels that they could
leave behind such a never fading flower of memory.
They must have gone forth to their travels
minutely familiar with the code of Japanese<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
etiquette, so thoroughly were they skilled in fracturing
it. A riot might have been forgiven, and
forgotten, but not the throwing of rice on the
floor. The one constant forbidding under which a
child is brought up finally leaves no process of
thought in the brain that anyone could ever intentionally
offend against the cleanness of the
matting. It is less a <i lang="fr">gaucherie</i> to set fire to a
friend’s house and burn it to the ground than to
spill a bowl of soup.</p>
<p>We waited for the rain to clear away, but as it
did not we borrowed huge paper umbrellas and
wandered off down the valley. We were in the
midst of a silk spinning district and in almost
every doorway sat some woman of the household
busily capturing the silken threads from the cocoons.
We asked permission to rest in the door
of a carpenter’s shop which overhung the rocky
Kiso and was shaded by the tops of great pines
which grew from the sides of the valley bed.
The carpenter brought us tea and stopped for a
moment to point the view through the trees which
had been the companion of his life.</p>
<p>Sometimes poverty seems to be an absolute
and unarguable condition; at other times one’s
ideas as to the what and when of poverty are so
shifting as merely to be interrogations. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
was the poverty in that valley of the struggle for
some slight margin above dire want; the silk
workers were speeding their machines for their
pittance; the carpenter was busy through every
hour of daylight. Economics and efficiency are
everyday words but what is their ultimate meaning
not in dollars but in life? What are the real
wishes of the leaders in Tokyo, the statesmen
who are planning policies and at the same time
must strive to please the great banking houses
of the world?—do they look forward to the time
when factories will fill the land and the spinners
will not be sitting in their own doorways but
the children of to-day’s workers will be standing
in long rows before machines? “We are taught,”
explained a Japanese, “to pay our heavy taxes
cheerfully so that the empire may expand and
develop. Wealth will be thus created and then
taxes can be reduced.”</p>
<p>Hori had remembrance of a traveller’s tale
which he had heard long before of an ancient
tea-house along the Kiso famous both for its
noodle soup and its view of the spot locally believed
to have been the awakening place of Urashima
when he returned from the Island of the
Dragon King. Considering that the story explicitly
states that Urashima awoke on the seashore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the faith of the inland believers is really
more marvellously imaginative than the story itself.
The trudging coolies whom we stopped
had never heard of the tea-house. Therefore we
knocked at the first gate we came to in the bamboo
wall along the road to find that our footsteps
had magically led us to the famed spot itself.
We left our muddy boots at the door and
a maid showed us the way to the balcony of the
room of honour from which we could see the
tumbling river. The view is called “The Awakening.”
An islet emerges from the foam of the
waters and its rocks have been made to serve as
a miniature temple garden. There is another
view farther down the bank, from which the
dwarfed pines and stone lanterns of the island
may be seen to better advantage. Cicerones lie
in wait there for the sightseer. In delightful
contrast to the urgings generally experienced from
the tribe, these guides were quite shy in the presence
of foreigners.</p>
<p>The daughter of the house, in a <i lang="ja">kimono</i> of silk
and brocade, herself brought the tray of tea and <i lang="ja">sake</i> and a pyramid dish of noodles. The porcelain
was old and of tempting beauty. The tea
was fragrant. Hori insisted that we should extemporize
poetry to express our appreciation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
beauty of the Kiso, but O-Owre-san and I were
rather self-conscious in our rhymes. We had been
nurtured in a land of specialization where poetry
is entrusted to professionals. The sun came out.
We paid our reckoning, folded up our paper umbrellas,
and walked back to our inn for a long
night’s sleep.</p>

<h2>VI<br>
<span class="titlefont">THE ADVENTURE OF THE BOTTLE INN</span></h2>
<p>In the morning Hori discovered that his military
survey map somehow had been mistaken for
a sheet of wrapping paper the day before. The
torn-off section had served to carry rice cakes in
my pocket. The tearing had strangely traversed
mountains, valleys, and rivers along almost the
line we purposed following. As Hori was still
unemancipated from the idea that not to know
where one is is to be lost, he was rather in a maze
for the next few days, as we continually wandered
off the edge of the map into unknown regions.
He must have marvelled at times over the kindness
of the Providence which had guided our
steps from Kyoto to Nagoya.</p>
<p>The valley of the Kiso earnestly seeks to attest
the theory that the inhabitants of localities
with a similar climate and topography tend to
have similar ideas, especially in working out
ways of doing the same thing. The wide sweeping
view with the snow-topped mountains on the
horizon might have been Switzerland, and for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
more decisive deceiving of the eye into thinking
so the cottages of the peasants had the overhanging
roof of the Swiss chalet with the same pitch
and the same arrangement of rows of boulders on
them. It is a province, also, of trousered women.</p>
<p>We came upon a wistful-eyed, pink-cheeked,
timid fairy of the mountains. She was carrying
on her back a huge, barrel-shaped basket and she
bent forward as she slowly walked along, her eyes
fixed on a handful of wild flowers in her fingers.
Even our modest knowledge of the folklore of
the land told us that she must be a princess who
had been captured by ugly trolls. They had set
her to impossible labour as their revenge against
her beauty. A young man whose niche in the
world was beyond our determining—although we
thought he might be a student on a vacation walking
trip—had caught up with us a half-hour before
and had been measuring his step with ours.
When he discovered that I wished to take a picture
of the princess he assisted with such effective
blandishment of speech that she halted for an instant.
When I asked that I might also photograph
him, he laughed and vaulted up among the
rocks and disappeared.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 469px;" id="Ref_128" role="figure" aria-labelledby="ebm_caption4">
<img alt="" height="650" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Samurai Trails, by Lucian Swift Kirtland._files/i135.jpg" width="469" id="id-4283846202167955828">
<div class="caption" id="ebm_caption4"><p>WE CAME UPON A WISTFUL-EYED, TIMID FAIRY OF THE MOUNTAINS</p></div>
</div>
<p>A little farther along we met the six sisters
of the princess. They were carrying burdens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
equally as large and heavy as had she, but they
were not so pretty nor so wistful, albeit they were
just as timid. We never could find any key to
the mystery why our appearance along the highway
would sometimes be as startling as if we
were ghostly apparitions, and at other times it
would merely bring about a casual interest and
staring, if it brought any interest at all. Upon
this occasion it was a panic. The six maidens beheld
us, they shrieked in unison, and they jumped
from the road, trying to hide behind rocks and
trees. Their lithe limbs might have carried them
like fawns, if their shoulders had been freed
from the huge baskets, but, as it was, their flight
was more like that of some new and enormous variety
of the beetle tribe, evoluted so far as to wear
cotton clothes and to have pretty human heads
turbaned under blue and white handkerchiefs.
As a son of Daguerre, I should have tarried for
an instant to photograph their amazing struggle,
but an upsetting obsession of chivalry hurried us
on. By the time we turned to look back they
had scrambled to the road, all six princesses accounted
for. They, too, turned to look at us
and from the safety of distance began to laugh.
The comedy might thus have ended if it had not
been that at that instant Hori rounded the bend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of the road with his thumb pressed vigorously
against the strident bicycle bell. The beetles (or,
better to say, the wingless butterflies) again took
flight. We awaited their second reappearance.
This time they did not venture laughter until they
reached the curve and made sure of no further
dismay.</p>
<p>Hori dismounted and pushed the bicycle along
and we entered into one of our unending discussions.
A subject sometimes in debate was O-Owre-san’s
and my intense interest—our curiosity—in
the conversations that Hori had with passersby
along the road or in the shops. Sometimes,
when we had made some simple inquiry in a
shop, Hori would ask a long question; the shopkeeper
would answer; Hori would enter a counter
dissertation; the shopkeeper would make his reply
to that; Hori would reply; the shopkeeper
would reply; Hori would reply; and then it might
be that the shopkeeper would have the conclusion.
Hori might then turn to us with: “He says
‘no.’”</p>
<p>In the port city shops where English is spoken,
if there is but one clerk he will answer your
questions immediately. If there are two, every
question is thoroughly discussed in Japanese before
answering, and if there be three, four, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
five clerks, the debate goes on to extraordinary
length. Again and again we asked Hori for a
complete translation but it must have been that he
believed within himself that he had asked the
question in the simplest terms, for we seldom got
a verbatim translation.</p>
<p>We were in the midst of some such discussion
when we looked up to see an old man standing
before us, leaning on a long staff. His white
beard fell benignly and his steady eyes carried
a message of goodwill. He returned our greetings
by a dignified inclination of his head. We
were at the peak of the road and, as often may
be found at such points, there was a small rest tea-house
for travellers. We asked the old man if he
would sit down with us and share a pot of tea.</p>
<p>The iron pot, filled with mountain spring water,
steamed hospitably on the <i lang="ja">hibachi</i> and the fragrance
of the tea was a friendly invitation to relax.
Our guest stood his long staff in the corner, sat
down on a cushion, and drew his feet from his
dusty sandals. After the true manner of happily
met travellers he was easily persuaded to tell us
the tale of his wanderings. The translation is
somewhat rhetorical but, as Hori explained, the
tale was told in the language of etiquette.</p>
<p>“I was born,” said he, “in the forty-first year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of the rule of the Shogun Ienari. I was young
and am now old. My eighty and seven summers
have seen the downfall of the once mighty before
the rising to full glory of the Meiji, and now,
from the Palace of Yedo, shine upon us the divine
rays of the Way of Heaven. Great is the
Mercy of Enlightenment. The Eternal Glory is
the Way.</p>
<p>“As a child I knew these mountains which you
see. The provinces of our land were then fortified
by many castles and these roads were
traversed by armed men. The castles have been
razed to the ground but the temples of the gods
still stand. The two-sworded warriors have gone
but I, a humble pilgrim, walk the roads they once
knew. The white clouds rest in the blue sky above
Fuji-san as when I looked upon them as a child.
The clouds will rest above Fuji when these eyes
shall see them not.</p>
<p>“In the fourteenth year of my youth I took
the vow that my life should be lived in honouring
the holy images of Buddha, each and all as my
steps might find them, from the shrines erected
by the peasants to the bronze statues of the great
temples. I took the very staff which you see and
the clothes that were upon my back and bade my
family good-bye. Through the kindness in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
hearts of men, the lowly and the mighty, the gods
have provided me with food and rest. I have
travelled without illness and my spirit has known
the joy of the Way.”</p>

</div>
<p>In those years that his bowl had not gone empty
of rice, never, it may be believed, did anyone give
to him as a beggar asking. Japan is of the East,
possessing the intuition that the spiritual is a
mystic interflow.</p>
<p>His eyes were young; they were not clouded
in contemplation of the abstract. They sparkled
from a delight in life. It had not been demanded
of him that his vicarious pilgrimage should be
one of tragic sacrifice. He had given and he
had received. While his theoretical faith might
be that life is an illusion and only the Way is
eternal, nevertheless he was born to love his
fellowmen and he could not escape from the practical
faith that was in him that this temporal life
must be of some use and of some meaning. I remembered
in strange comparison a sturdy British
unemployed whom I had once come upon. He
was lying under a hedge in Monmouthshire. He
borrowed a pipeful of tobacco and then turned
over onto his back to gaze into the blue sky.
After a time he said: “Activity is a fever. Therefore
it is a disease. Laziness is a promise. Rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
and forgetfulness are divine.” He did not make
the effort to add a good-bye when I left him.</p>
<p>A path of our pilgrim led over the road which
we had just travelled. We parted, bowing many
times. Hori unfolded his ravaged map and found
a village named Narii a few miles farther along.
The railroad down in the valley according to the
map went somewhere near Narii. Hori’s nerves
had been rasped by the temperamental vagaries
of the bicycle on the steep slopes and he decided
to await a train, promising to meet us.</p>
<p>After a time our path dropped down to the
bed of the river. Across a bridge the road forked,
one branch continuing along the valley and the
other winding off into the hills. The hill trail,
particularly as it led into the unknown regions
off Hori’s map, tempted, and we shouted down
an inquiry to some children playing in the water.
They were successfully attempting to get as wet
as possible while remaining as dirty as possible.
There is a mystery which overhangs grimy Japanese
children. When the little noses present a constant
temptation to the <i lang="ja">seiyo-jin</i> handkerchief that
in itself is a caste sign that you will find the faces
of their fathers and mothers unhappy, dull, and
lustreless. When the children are brightly scoured
and polished there is a general appearance of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
happiness and contentment in the community. It
is not the simple equation that poverty equals
dirt; one village is scrubbed and the next one is
not—otherwise neither seems richer nor poorer
except in happy looks.</p>
<p>When we called to the children in the Kiso they
splashed out of the water like wild animals and
scattered in all directions, but as two naked infants
too small to run had been left on the shore,
first the girls and then the boys began to edge
back. They remained to stare. We pointed up
the mountain path and asked if it led to Narii.
Their gestures evinced a fierce encouragement to
essay the ridges as if they had the contempt of
the untamed for anything as conventional as a
broad valley road. As a matter of fact they were
undoubtedly saying that the valley road did not
lead to Narii. We discovered this later when we
could look down from the heights. Hori’s railroad
tunnelled the hills.</p>
<p>According to local belief our path carried us
over the “backbone” of the empire, and this
crossing spot is considered sacred ground. Accordingly
we should have paid special homage to
the local deity whose shrine we passed, but as we
were foreigners and in ignorance, the god perhaps
forgave us. Furthermore, we unknowingly passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a particularly renowned view of very holy Mount
Ontake. We probably did see the mountain, but
being uninformed, as I said, of this special view,
we did not hold ourselves in proper restraint
until reaching the exact spot for appreciation.
Instead we luxuriously and squanderously revelled
in all four directions of the compass. It is always
thus with the ignorant. Their indiscriminate
enthusiasm is more irritating to the intellectuals
than no appreciation at all. I was later
most depressingly snubbed for having missed the
sacred view by a scholar of things Japanese. He
knew it from prints and sacred writings. He said
that he himself would have journeyed to see the
reality if it had not been for the probable annoyance
of having to come in contact with so many
natives on the journey. He appeared to be
impatient that the British Museum does not commandeer
all views, temples, and abiding places of
art around the world and establish turnstiles
which will keep the natives out and let the scholars
in. When he actually grasped that our only reason
for having arrived at that particular spot
at all was that we had taken a turning to the
right instead of to the left, he declared that our
ideas of travelling evidence the same intelligence
as might the tripping of tumbling beans and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
our very presence at sacred places was a sacrilege.</p>
<p>We turned a corner that hung sharply over the
precipice. Around the bend the shelf spread
out into a miniature meadow. A peasant was
lying on the grass and his straw-bonneted ox was
leisurely nibbling. We sat down beside him
and O-Owre-san began searching in his rucksack
for a remaining cake of chocolate. During this
hunt the peasant kept his eyes carefully and
earnestly averted. I made the remark to him
that the view was <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#kirei" id="a-kirei" class="pginternal">kirei</a></i> and he replied by a nervous
<i lang="ja">hei</i>. O-Owre-san found the chocolate and broke
it into three parts. He handed one of the
squares to the peasant. The fingers that reached
out for it were trembling.</p>
<p>The man had imaginative eyes. It was plain
to see that he was suffering from some lively
remembrance of a mountain folklore demon story.
He knew that we were foxes or badgers who
had assumed human form, and that we had come
to him with no good intentions. He suspected a
subtle poison. But he had courage from one
thought. It is the common knowledge of the
countryside that while the demands of demon
badgers may not be directly refused, their evil
intent may often be thwarted by the crafty intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
of man. The immediate problem was
how to avoid the appearance of refusing to eat
the mysterious cake which was now getting soft
and moist in his hand. Suddenly he popped the
chocolate into his mouth, tin foil and all. Then
he pushed back the square into his hand almost
in the same movement. I pretended not to be
watching. He dropped his hand with elaborate
carelessness into the thickness of the grass. I felt
a sense of dramatic relievement myself.</p>
<p>During those minutes the ox had been no such
respecter of enchantment as had his master. Instead,
he had stood sniffing at our boots and
pulling up bits of grass round and about our
ankles, all the time rolling a pair of red, angry
eyes. Asiatic beasts of burden find something
antagonistic to their complaisance in the odour
of the Caucasian and this individual ox was progressing
toward a positive bovine dissatisfaction.
Furthermore, we were sitting on the sweetest
and most tender tufts of grass remaining. We
courteously dismissed the peasant to go his way.
His marked alacrity was quite welcome.</p>
<p>We lingered on the grass for a little while and
I told O-Owre-san my guesses. I elaborated
them into the hazard that the poor man—he
had not once turned to look back over his shoulder—might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
even then be fearing that the slight
taste from the chocolate would turn him into a
frog and his ox into a stork to eat him up; or
perhaps he might be in distress that he and his
beast might grow smaller and smaller until they
would disappear into thin air.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san had been examining the faintness
of the path. “I hope none of these things happen
until the man gets over the hills to Narii. The
hoof prints make an excellent trail,” he said.</p>
<p>It was time to sling on our packs and follow.
When we reached the next turn we could see
the peasant’s straw hat and the ox’s straw bonnet
bobbing along just over the bush tops. We
maintained this distance without closing the gap.
As O-Owre-san had predicted, the hoof marks
were useful. The path often grew so faint that
it had no other resolute indication. We had
been sure, without thought of other possibility,
that the crest of the hill we were climbing would
be the summit of the range. When we reached
the crest we stood looking up at another peak
rising from a shallow valley at our feet.</p>
<p>“Which way does the ox say to go?” I asked.</p>
<p>The hoof marks were there in the soft earth,
but where our feet had stopped there they had
stopped. They stopped as absolutely as if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
peasant and his ox had been whisked away in a
chariot to the sunset sky. The bushes were too
low for concealment. There was no cave, nor
hole in the earth.</p>
<p>If there be no such thing as magic, in the
Japanese mountains at least, where did that man
and his beast go? The disappearance was as complete
as the most exacting enchanter could have
desired. We found no answer to the riddle and
the sun was sinking, adding the next question of
how we were going to get out of the hills in
the night time if we delayed for scientific investigation.
We succumbed to expediency and took
a five-mile-an-hour pace over such trail as we had
left, guessing at the turns. When we finally
reached the next crest, deep in the valley we
could see Narii. Before descending the steep,
dropping path, we sat down near a spring where
the birds had come to drink. They were singing
evening songs mightily. Bright wild flowers were
scattered in the open spaces between the intense
green of the fern patches. The world was lustily
at peace.</p>
<p>When we did start we swung down the long
hill almost at a run and in a half-hour reached
the edge of the village to find Hori sitting under
a stone lantern in the temple yard. The evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
peace had made us positive that this is the best
of all possible worlds, but Hori was entertaining
a different idea. He looked exceedingly gloomy.
We were impatient of any discontent. If he
had said that men were starving for rice in the
village beyond, the fitting answer would have
seemed to us the historic words of the good queen:
“Give them cake.” Undoubtedly when the message
about the starving peasants was brought to
that Lady of France she was sitting under the
shrubbery at Versailles, and the birds were singing,
and it was springtime, and perhaps the fountains
were playing. Impellingly she realized with
an insight deeper than any historian has ever
appreciated that upon such a glorious day, if there
is any such thing as right or justice at all in
this world, a certain amount of cake should be
everybody’s inalienable possession.</p>
<p>As it happened, Hori’s worry had nothing to
do with altruistic sorrow for starving villagers,
but existed from a lively interest in our own affairs.
The town was very poor, he explained, a
town come down in the world from ancient prosperity.
Its neck was hung with the millstone
of decayed graces and thinned blood. The inn
was so old that it was senile. Hori had established
some excuse before entering the door for inspection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
which later allowed his rejection of the inn’s
hospitality, but it would never do for us in
turn to venture in for a glance around. That
would be needlessly raising the expectation of the
ancient host. We would find, he suggested, that
it would be only five or six or seven miles to the
next village. As we had had twenty-five or more
miles behind us and most of those had been along
mountain paths, we were not so inevitably tempted
at that hour of night to be particular in a choice
of roofs as Hori, who had come by train, was
imagining.</p>
<p>The inn, in truth, was very old. By any law
of survival chances the wandering wings should
have burned to earth long ago. To greet us there
were no smiling and chattering maids gathered
behind a mistress; instead, an old man and a
very small girl, his granddaughter or more likely
his great-granddaughter, met us in the dark
entrance with protests that the house was unworthy
of our presence. We hastily denied
them their words. Hori could employ the polite
phrases of Japan. We impulsively, directly, and
bluntly told them “no.” It was not alone the
pathos of the two figures which appealed. It
was somewhat that their dignity had not surrendered
to ruin, and it was somewhat a something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
else, indescribable, in the atmosphere that
charmed.</p>
<p>We followed the master along a labyrinthine
corridor. The soft wood planks of the floor
had been polished to a deep reddish gleam under
the bare feet of generations of hurrying <i lang="ja">ne-sans</i>.
He led us past inner courtyards to the farthest
wing. Our room hung over the river at an elbow
of the stream. Even with the <i lang="ja">shogi</i> pushed wide
open we were hidden completely from the eyes
of the town by heavily leafed trees.</p>
<p>The mats on the floor had turned a dingy,
mottled brown and black from their once light
golden yellow, but they were clean. The sacred
<i lang="ja">takemona</i> corner still compelled its importance.
It had been built in an age when the demand for
its existence was the ardent faith of the builders
rather than an architectural tradition. The room
was about thirty-five feet long and fifteen feet
deep, perhaps a little larger. The ceiling was
proportionately high.</p>
<p>Hori was still doubtful, not gloomily so, but
from the knowledge that an inn is proved by its
service. The host was kneeling, as immobile as
a temple image, awaiting our orders. His skin
was as bloodless as the vellum of the painting
which hung behind him. His watchful eyes, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
were intensely bright in their deep sockets.
Hori began inquiries about dinner. The ancient
bowed his head to the floor, drawing in his breath
sharply against his teeth. Dinner was now being
prepared for his family, he said, but it would be
unworthy of his guests. The formal phrase of
polite deprecation carried this truth, as Hori
discovered by further questioning; it was not
that the dinner was or was not worthy—it was
the failure of <em>quantity</em>. We should not have long
to wait, said our host, but food would have to
be sent for.</p>
<p>As we sat in a circle planning what we should
have, the old man smiled and pointed to a patched
square in the matting. Underneath the square,
he said, was a depression for holding bronze
braziers. When the nobility, in the old feudal
times, had travelled the Nakescendo trail, this
was the room of honour that had been given to
the <i lang="ja">daimyos</i>. It had been often the custom for
the retainers of a <i lang="ja">daimyo</i> themselves to prepare
his dinner over the braziers. Our sitting there,
planning what we should have, had reminded him
of the dead past. His words came slowly as if
between each word of recollection his spirit journeyed
back into the very maw of oblivion and
then had to return again to the world.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<p>“Are the braziers still hidden there?” Hori
interrupted.</p>
<p>Yes, the braziers were under the floor or somewhere
to be found.</p>
<p>Hori turned to us and put us through a questioning
until he rediscovered the word “picnic”
for his vocabulary. “That’s what we will have,
a picnic, right here,” he declared, and he turned
back to the host to explain. The old man almost
gasped, at least approaching as near to such
escape of emotion as he probably ever had at
the request of a guest.</p>
<p>“But you will then have to have a special
waitress,” he said. “My granddaughter is indeed
too young for that privilege.” Always when he
used depreciatory adjectives about the child’s unworthiness
he failed lamentably to harden his
caressing tone. She was, however, as he had
said, little older than a baby. The services of
a maid we should have to pay for, but, under
the spell of the conjuring up of the memories of
those bygone revels in our room, what cared we
for saving our precious <i lang="ja">yen</i>? We had become
reincarnations of the two-sworded swaggerers.
We waved our arms grandiloquently.</p>
<p>“Tell him to send for fowls for the pot,” we
oratorically assailed Hori. “Let us mix rich<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
sauces and warm the <i lang="ja">sake</i>. And tell him to remember
that for us there can be but one choice—the
maid to serve our dinner must be the prettiest
maid in all Narii.”</p>
<p>I had not the slightest idea that Hori would
translate our exact words, but I found later that
such was his act.</p>
<p>Thus the mountain village of Narii faced a
problem. Two foreigners, and a Japanese almost
as alien as a foreigner, had appeared from nobody
knew where, not preceded, ’twas true, by
retainers as had been the travellers of old, but
nevertheless demanded the old-time service with
as much gusto as if they were accustomed to
having what they wished. They had asked that
the prettiest maid in all Narii be called to the
inn to exercise the privilege of guarding the steaming
rice box. It was obvious that there could
be only one prettiest maid, and all Narii knew
with one mind that the prettiest maid was the
daughter of the Shinto priest. However, the
daughter of a priest is not a likely candidate for
service in an inn, even if the master has ever
been a faithful devotee of the temple. Nevertheless
there was the honour of the hospitality
of Narii at stake. Messengers (or even appropriately,
it might be said, heralds) were sent to explain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the problem to the maid and her father,
and to use, if necessary, the pressure of “the
state demands.”</p>
<p>Thus came O-Hanna-san to the inn. (In all
Japan there cannot be a prettier, a more bashful,
or a more modest maiden.) Her eyes were downcast
behind long black lashes. Her soft cheek
flushed and paled—perhaps somewhat from the
excitement of the adventure. Neither she nor
her friends had ever seen one of that strange race,
the foreigner. And, indeed, even a priest’s daughter
may think that to be chosen as the prettiest
maid——!! Ah, her courage failed her to glance
up and words would not come to her lips to answer
their questions, but they did not seem to be
so very predatory nor so very fearsome—and they
were very hungry.</p>
<p>Two great bronze braziers had been filled with
glowing charcoal. The foreigners and the outer-world
Japanese who could speak their strange
words were busily cooking the fowls, chopped into
dice, and they were arguing about their respective
talents and abilities, as do all amateur cooks.
Perhaps she could now look up for an instant
unobserved. No, a glance met her eyes
and she felt hot blushes grow again on her
cheek.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>
<p>While they feasted and laughed she had to
run many times to the kitchen for forgotten dishes.
When she passed along the hall by the entrance
to the street she was each time stopped and
besieged by the questions of the gathered mob.
(Some of those inquiring investigators had also
gathered outside the wall of my bath an hour
before. I had been suddenly aware of an eye
at every crack and crevice of the boards as I was
cautiously stepping into the superheated tub.
There was not a sound, merely the glitter of their
star-scattered eyes.)</p>
<p>The foreigners put sugar on their rice and one
of them even put sugar in his tea. They handled
their chopsticks so awkwardly that it was marvellous
that they did not spill the rice grains on the
matting. She thought of the twenty rules in etiquette
for the proper and graceful use of chopsticks
and she imagined that if there had been a
ten score of rules they might have all been
broken. At last the three feasters finished their
mighty meal and stretched out on the cushions
to smoke in deep contentment. She doubted
whether they had even noticed that her superior
<i lang="ja">kimono</i> was not such as a maid of an inn would
possess. After the feast her quick feet, in spotless
white <i lang="ja"><a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/53327/pg53327-images.html#tabi" id="a-tabi" class="pginternal">tabi</a></i>, carried away the bowls and little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
tables. Then she sat down by the door to await
any further clapping of hands.</p>
<p>The host came in, moving silently across the
matting. He kneeled and bent his forehead to
the floor. Before the meal he had himself arranged
the flowers, in an old iron vase, to stand
in the <i lang="ja">takemona</i> corner. We tried to express our
appreciation for the flowers and our admiration
of the vase.</p>
<p>We asked him how old the inn was. It had
been his father’s before him, and his grandfather’s
before his father. Yes, in those days the Nakescendo
had rivalled the Tokaido, and yearly, on
the hastening to Yedo to give obeisance to the
Shogun, the great nobles of the northwest provinces
with their armed retainers had had to pass
through Narii. In the pride of their gifts to
the Shogun, in their numbers, in their courage,
they had never yielded place to the envoys from
the great families of the South. This now forgotten
inn had then been famous. Our room,
overhanging the river, he repeated, had been only
given to the <i lang="ja">daimyos</i>. The <i lang="ja">samurai</i> had crowded
the other rooms. The inn had boasted a score,
two score, of trained and pretty <i lang="ja">ne-sans</i> to wait
upon those fiery warriors. (The modern <i lang="ja">geisha</i>,
in many of her accomplishments, is daughter to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the inn maidens of the feudal days who sang and
danced and played musical instruments in addition
to the graces of more domestic duties.) The
inn had then rung with shouting and laughter,
and sometimes the dawn of the morning start of
the cavalcade found the retainers still sitting
around the feast.</p>
<p>On the road to Yedo their purses had hung full,
but the great city always plunged both its hands
into those purses filled from the rice taxes, and
it was often quite another story—the return journey
back to the provincial castles. No rare occurrence
was it indeed, for some haughty <i lang="ja">samurai</i>
to declare in the morning that he could not pay
his inn bill, however modest it might be. Upon
one occasion a certain warrior had been forced
to leave in pledge the first mistress of his heart—his
sword. A <i lang="ja">daimyo</i>, overlord of a province,
could, of course, never be in debt to an innkeeper,
although he might leave a <em>gift</em> for his host instead
of money. When such eventuality as that arose
the host would declare (wisely) that his hospitality
had been unworthy of any remuneration and
that he was a thousand times repaid by the magnificence
of the gift.</p>
<p>Yes, went on the old man, once a noble upon
leaving the door had caused a vase to be unwrapped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
from its encasements of one silken bag
after another and had given it to the inn. The
donor had written a poem of dedication with his
own hand. The vase was shaped like a bottle and
the inn had been called “The Bottle Inn” from
that day, seventy years in the past. Our host, a
youth on that day, had thought that the inn would
ever be rich and renowned. He sighed. The
tradition of its renown had faded and been forgotten
in this age of railways. No longer did
turbulent guests demand that the bottle be brought
out and shown.</p>
<p>If his dramatic genius had been subtly leading
us toward turbulence, we obeyed the pulling of
the strings. We demanded to know whether the
vase was still under his roof. Our host smiled.
The sacred vase was hidden safely. Would we
like to see it?</p>
<p>He returned, carrying an old wooden box. The
great-granddaughter dragged the unredeemed
sword after her. The well-worn scabbard of the
sword was of mediocre, conventional design, but
the blade had been forged by one of the famous
sword makers. Hori read the sword’s origin
from the characters carved in the steel. The old
man slowly slipped the sword back into the scabbard,
leaving us to ponder what might have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the tragic fate of the <i lang="ja">ronin</i> that he had never returned
for his pledge.</p>
<p>No casket of precious metal can be so alluringly
suggestive of trove as the simple, unpainted,
pine boxes into which the Japanese put their
treasures. A woven cord clasped down the lid
of the box. The untying of it began the breathless
ceremony. When the lid was lifted we saw the
first silken wrapping, then came another, and another,
and another. Some were of brocade, some
were of faded plain colour,—red, blue, or rose.
Finally the drawing string of the last bag was
pulled open and the old man lifted the bottle.
It was of yellow pottery with a thick brown
glaze overrunning the sides. The mouth of the
vase was capped by a bronze and silver band
carved with an irregular motif.</p>
<p>The trustee of the possession allowed us to
pass it from hand to hand.</p>
<p>What was one of our reasons for being in Narii
at that very moment? It was that our eyes were
prying for those rarer treasures in Japan which
may be sometimes gleaned “away from the beaten
path.” Unaccountable chance had led us to the
inn. The old man was hopelessly beaten in his
contest with poverty. I knew that he did not
wish to sell, but if there should be the jingling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of a few <i lang="ja">yen</i>—was it likely that he could refuse?
Our eyes were gleaming with desire. Surely,
even if it were a venal sin to take away the
bottle from The Bottle Inn the very greatness
of the temptation would have brought its own
special forgiveness. But because temptation and
conscience can generally be argued around to our
satisfaction, the gods have ironically added impulse
as the third part of us. It must have been
some such impulse which was the irrational lever
which moved us to action. We soared to the
heights. It was a superior endurance to any
flight that it is likely either of us will ever attempt
again. Truly such virtue is more regretted
than gloried in. We did not take the bottle with
us. It still functions in its environment, in harmony
with its tradition. Taken away it could
be only a superior vase with a history, an object
of art. In that old inn it is a living part, an
inspiration. In the forgotten village of Narii no
numbered museum tag hangs around its neck.</p>
<p>The bottle dropped back into the brocade bag
lined with faded crimson silk. Then the other
wrappings, one by one, muffled it. It went into
the box, the lid was fitted into place, and the cord
was tied. Do we gain strength from resisting
such temptation? The writers of the Holy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Church of the Middle Ages said so. By refusing
that bottle I merely gained exhaustion. This
moment I am stifled by the dust of the ashes of
that murdered passion. My conscience replies
with no response. It has lost the vitality of recoil,
and thus, if ever such time may come, I may
yet glory in a greater vandalism, some supreme
Hunnish act, and there will be no rasping regret.</p>
<p>The breezes up among the snows of the mountains
came down into the valley for the night.
Wherever they were going they seemed to be
quite undetermined as to their path. They blow
from every side and into every corner of the
room by turn. Little by little, to escape the
draughts, we had kept pushing along the wooden
shutters until we were at length completely walled
in. It was not possible to imagine that a few
miles away, down on the rice plains, the millions
were nudely stifling while we were going to bed
to get warm. The daughter of the priest had been
dragging layers of bedding to the door and, when
we clapped our hands, she had innumerable mattresses
for each of us. For once it was unnecessary
to stretch the mosquito netting. There
seemed to be nothing left but to blow out the
lights and cry: “<i lang="ja">O yasumi nasai!</i>” to the retreating
patter of her footsteps.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>
<p>“What’s the midget granddaughter waiting
for?” I asked Hori.</p>
<p>“She wants you to go to bed,” said he from
under his quilt.</p>
<p>I jumped into the soft centre of my mattresses
as requested. Then the butterfly dropped on her
knees and crept backward around our beds. Out
of a box she was pouring a train of powder until
she had us each enclosed in a magic circle.</p>
<p>“Why?” I demanded.</p>
<p>Kenjiro laughed at me.</p>
<p>“It’s <i lang="ja">nomi-yoke</i>,” he said. “Insect powder—what
do you say in America? Bug medicine?”</p>
<p>I insisted that I had not seen the sign of a
bug or an insect or a flea or anything looking like
a marauder.</p>
<p>“Of course not,” Hori stopped me as if I
should have known better. “It’s just courtesy
to honoured guests, to show you that they would
wish to protect you if there were any. If there
were crawlers,” he concluded with some scorn,
“do you suppose they’d make such an effort to
call attention to the fact?”</p>
<p>That <i lang="ja">bushido</i> explanation satisfied Hori but I
was doubtful. For the sake of verification I carefully
destroyed the integrity of the rampart
around my bed by opening up passages through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the powder. I was willing to display a few bites
in the morning to prove the truth. I went to
sleep dreaming about two-sworded <i lang="ja">samurai</i> who
looked like pinch bugs, and they were swaggering
around a wall of insect powder. However, the
morning proved that Hori was quite correct. The
delicate attention had been born of pure courtesy.</p>

<div id="THE_IDEALS_OF_A_SAMURAI">
<h2>VII<br>
<span class="titlefont">THE IDEALS OF A SAMURAI</span></h2>
<p>In the morning we found great brass basins of
water waiting for us in the sunny iris garden.
One of the super-errors that a foreigner can make
in a native inn is to ask to have the basins
brought to his room. Such a request can be understood
only as a perversion, or a barbarity.
One reason why the houses and inns seem so
clean is that they eliminate so many of the chances
for their being otherwise; and this defence might
be added into the weighing when criticizing Japanese
nudity at ablutions.</p>
<p>Breakfast was brought to us steaming under
the lacquer covers of the bowls, but the priest’s
daughter was not holding the wooden ladle for
the rice. It was a rather late hour when she had
returned to her father’s house, but the mothers
and daughters of a Japanese home are accustomed
to having their working hours overlap into the
night. In subtlety we brazenly accused each other
of having frightened the gentle <i lang="ja">ne-san</i> into not
returning. The truth was—as it afterwards came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
out—that we had each found opportunity to hint
to the host’s ear the night before that the maid’s
slumber by no means should be disturbed for our
morning’s start. Thus we each privately thought
we knew the secret of her non-appearance, but
just as we were tying on our shoes at the door a
breathless message was brought by her small
brother. She had overslept. It had not been
our late hour which was responsible. The family
of the Shinto priest had sat up almost until the
first light in the East to listen to the wonder
tale of their daughter who had endured such a
singular and daring adventure.</p>
<p>The ancient host gave us presents and we gave
him presents. We said our farewells at the door
and then, after that, he and his granddaughter
walked along with us half through the village.
Finally we bowed our formal seven bows of farewell.
When we reached the end of the street
we turned and saw them still standing where we
had left them.</p>
<p>The road led across a wide, flat valley. That
morning there was a truly extraordinary phenomenon.
The claret red of the sun flamed and
danced against the snows of the mountain wall
at our left. Finally our road broke up into a
delta of small paths. The soft earth had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
so cut into ruts by heavy carts that Hori was
forced to accede to the demands of the bicycle
that it should be assisted and not ridden, but he
did not surrender until the wheel had demonstrated
its malevolence by pitching him a half-dozen
times off the saddle. Thus we all walked
along together. The villages were rather mean,
with the air of having come down in the world.
Some of the towns, in the days before machinery,
had had special fame in the various handicrafts;
one had been known for its hand-made wooden
combs. Evidently there remain some conservatives
who have not yet countenanced modern vulcanite
innovations, as wooden combs were still
being made for sale. Entire families, from grandparents
to children, were the manufacturers, the
factories their own homes. We bought a boxful
for a few <i lang="ja">sen</i>. In arriving at a selling price
they must have valued their time in the manufacturing
as a gratuitous contribution to the
arts.</p>
<p>Every once in a while O-Owre-san and I had
had our pleasure in drawing the long bow of our
imagination concerning the architectural reason
for a certain peculiar type of house. A recurring
example is to be found in nearly every village.
These buildings are unusually substantial and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the windows are always heavily barred and shuttered.
They give a suggestion of descent from
the castles of feudal days. As I said, we had employed
our elaborate imagining over the mysterious
buildings, but our guesses had never
brought us anywhere near to the truth. Hori
explained that they are the houses of the pawnbrokers.
Hori is the son of a <i lang="ja">samurai</i>. (He has
the right to wear, if he wishes, the full number
of crests on his formal <i lang="ja">kimono</i>.) The artists who
made the old colour prints used to give to the
eyes of the two-sworded <i lang="ja">samurai</i> an expression
of warlike ferocity. When Hori spoke of the
pawnbrokers his eyes glared, and I was sure that
I detected his hand starting to reach for the
sword that has now gone from his girdle. However,
the ubiquitous bicycle just then swung
around and entangled him, as a reminder, probably,
that this is a new age, a mechanical and not
a feudal one, and that a <i lang="ja">samurai</i> no longer has the
general and hearty acquiescence of law and society
to proceed to direct action against the loathed
money lender. The law of the land says to-day
that the pawnbroker must be considered as a free
and equal citizen, enjoying full rights under the
mercy of the Mikado; albeit (as the bars and shutters
of his windows show), the money lender still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
wisely believes in keeping his powder dry even in
an age of enlightenment.</p>
<p>When we had extricated Hori from the bicycle
and we had all got going again, he explained
why the pawnbroker is the most hated member of
Nipponese society. Here are some of the other
remarks that Hori made about pawnbrokers:</p>
<p>They are always rich. (He meant the Asiatic
wealth,—hoards of gold, not a checking account
at a bank.)</p>
<p>They are uncanny.</p>
<p>They lead isolated, unhappy lives.</p>
<p>They always have a beautiful daughter (one
only) to fall heir to the riches.</p>
<p>This daughter dreams of noble lovers, but no
Japanese, whatever his rank, be it noble, humble,
or decayed (or, for that matter, no matter how
much in debt he may be to her father), would ever
throw away his pride to wed a pawnbroker’s
daughter. Thus she is left to grieve out her heart
in the midst of her father’s luxury.</p>
<p>A Japanese believes certain things patriotically.
I know that Hori does not believe these same
things intellectually, for I was once rude enough
to continue an argument until he capitulated
intellectually—but for the love of country and
the required loyalty to what should be, he also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
keeps to the beliefs which he should have as
a Japanese. After all, juxtapositioned to such
faith, mere intellectual judgment does seem lacking
in vital fluid.</p>
<p>The hiatus in Hori’s Japanese life—the foreign
period and influence—began when he was of the
high school age and went to America. Thus,
at the time when the mind is supposed to be most
receptive, he was separated from the traditions
and ethical customs of his homeland, and he made
no return home until he had left his American university.
A peculiar duality may come from such
a training. It would be impossible otherwise, for
instance, that one individual should really appreciate
both a symphony orchestra and a <i lang="ja">samisen</i>,
not so much from the angle of technical divergence
in the use of notes, tones, and scales as in
aesthetic comparison. To any human being with
emotional sensitiveness and response, not possessing
a dual personality, acknowledgment of the
rights of the symphony would seem to preclude
those of the <i lang="ja">samisen</i>.</p>
<p>I had lost my Japanese pipe. Those little iron
bowls continue to be a most admirable luxury
through all of the days that one is in the land of
their invention. When the traveller leaves the
shores of Japan he takes away with him packages<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of silken tobacco and his pipe, only to find that
he never lights it again. The charm is broken
when the circle is broken, and the circle, I suppose,
is a unity when one is lying on the cushions
of a balcony overlooking a garden, and a maid
brings the charcoal <i lang="ja">hibachi</i> and a pot of tea.
You touch the bowl of the pipe to the fire and
then—three puffs and a half. You knock the ash
into a bamboo cup. Perhaps the maid refills
the pipe, touches it to the charcoal, and hands it
to you again.</p>
<p>Ordinarily these pipes are sold everywhere, but
at Narii we could not find them. When we were
walking into Shiogiri I asked Hori to help me
keep an eye on the shops as we passed. After a
time he said: “Here we are. Here’s a one-price
store.”</p>
<p>We had not come upon just such a shop before.
While the stock and the arrangement was purely
native, the atmosphere of the place was distinctly
un-Japanese. A little of everything was for sale,
but instead of the selling being a social ceremony,
the shopkeeper and his wife and his sons and his
daughters were expeditious clerks and not hosts.
The entering customer asked for what he wished
to see, and a price tag told him the cost. That
was the beginning and the end of any bargaining.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>
<p>In the conventional shop the buyer sits down
leisurely, after removing his <i lang="ja">geta</i>, and perhaps
has a cup of tea. If an ordinary utility is wished,
the negotiating is necessarily devoid of much opportunity
for extended approach, consideration,
and conclusion, but it is always to be remembered
that our idea of what is a waste of time may be
the Japanese idea of a valuably used moment.
The little shops have no opening and closing hours.
Literally, there is all the time there is. The
clerk does not sell eight, nine, or ten hours of
his day to his employer. He sells all of it.
As it is impossible to keep at high pressure for
maybe twenty hours of the twenty-four (and
twenty hours is not an exaggeration in some instances)
nature’s insistence for rest has to come
out of the working day. The fact that the workers
are not awaiting the striking of a clock for
their liberty, but are more or less taking it as
it comes, accounts for what is often a mystery
to travellers, the easy gaiety of a busy Japanese
street. Workmen put down their tools and stop
for a visit; the shopkeeper chats indefinitely
with a customer; the maids at the inns have
plenty of time to light pipes for the guests and
pour tea. Our idea is that the individual’s liberty
begins at the sharp demarcation of the hour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
which ceases to belong to the employer. After
the wanderer has lived for a time in the midst
of the Oriental system, the impression comes that
time is a continuous flow and that it is not a succession
of intervals as it is with us. The people
of the East have even found a counteracting
thrust to oppose the tyranny of the railroad schedule.
By arriving at the station indefinitely early
they can show their contempt for definite departures.</p>
<p>While we were buying my new twelve-<i lang="ja">sen</i> pipe
in the Shiogiri one-price store, Hori commented
with obvious emphasis several times that he was
pleased that the prices were so carefully marked
on the tags. As smoking may at any time become
a ceremony, I spent many minutes in my
selection, and through these minutes Hori kept
dropping his pointed comments, but I stored away
the impression of his satisfaction over the price
tags to be asked about later. An appropriate
time did not come for several days. An hour
came when we were lounging on an inn balcony
in the soft night air.</p>
<p>It seemed that our method of shopping was the
disturbing pressure against Hori’s peace of mind.
We two foreigners undoubtedly had many flaws
which came to light under the wear of intimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
association, but it was this one which at last
drove Hori to the verge where he had to unburden
his feelings. In the curio shops, or wherever
we were making purchases, when we came
upon something that interested us, we immediately
asked: “How much?” It had been natural,
when Hori was with us, to rely upon him
to interpret rather than to employ our own
cumbrous methods of transmitting ideas. As
soon as we received an intimation of the bargain
price we proceeded to the bargaining and
continued until we arrived at what was presumably
the lowest compromise of the shopkeeper.
Hori had also noticed that we sometimes put off
deciding whether we really wished to purchase
until we discovered the eventual price. We quite
reversed the ceremonial purchase making enacted
by a Japanese gentleman. As Hori witnessed it,
the difference was meaningful. The Japanese collector
looks first of all at an object to see whether
it merits his attention. If it does, there follows
an extended conversation about its intrinsic excellence.
Every question as to artistic value,
authenticity, age, workmanship, uniqueness—these
are all settled before a word about the price arises.
If the object does not equal his demands of it, the
collector departs without inquiry about the money<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
value—for why should he be interested in the
cost of an article if not in the article itself?</p>
<p>Hori shook his head sadly. “You always ask
right away: ‘How much?’” he said. “That
sounds very mercenary to us. It looks as if you
were more interested in cheapness than quality.”</p>
<p>We had not suspected that Hori was writhing
when, under the pressure of our Occidental impetus,
he had been asking for us the questions of
price. As a matter of fact, be it to his credit
and our discredit, despite the simplification of
his quick interpreting against our imperfect use of
the few words that we did know, when it came
to the detail of price our efforts often seemed to
be able to effect a more extraordinary drop from
the original quotation than when such arguing
was put off until all other details were settled.
It is true that the merchants who have really
fine things will not show nor sell their best to
customers whose appreciation they doubt, but
it may also be true that as far as we did have
appreciation, we made up our minds more quickly
than does the Japanese collector, and thus the
stages of consideration which Hori missed were
not so much lacking as they were abbreviated.</p>
<p>The standards of the <i lang="ja">samurai</i> when he goes
forth to make purchases should not be confused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
as being an index to the methods of modern
Japan in attacking the world’s markets. In such
trading there is no nation which is more intent
upon giving the customer what the customer
thinks he wants, and price and profit are sufficiently
an affair of cold business to be safely
refrigerated against any germs of sentimentalism.
Hori was speaking as the son of the civilization
which flowered in the feudal days. Whatever
that civilization was, it was not commercial. In
that old régime the shopkeeper was only a shopkeeper,
and a discussion of ethics in trade occupied
little space in the code of honour of the
nation. When Hori’s fathers stopped to buy a
fan or a bronze or a roll of brocade or sandals
for their feet, or whatever it might be that they
wished, bargaining stopped as soon as they
reached the end of their patience—and they were
most impatient warriors. They might arrogantly
pay what was asked, or, if their patience
was too far gone, they might lop off the head
of the obdurate merchant. The last probability
had a tendency to keep prices fairly near to an
equitable level when the two-sworded men were
purchasers.</p>
<p>It is not an appreciated trait in the modern
world to have contempt for money. Japan’s nobility,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
when the <i lang="ja">Shogun</i> ruled, had sincere contempt
for money. There is something dramatic,
even noble, in having such a contempt, but it
must be said that it is a much easier possession
to maintain if back of it the possessors have the
inalienable ownership of their landed estates.
The descendants of the ancient orders in Japan
do not own the land to-day and, examining their
position in the cold light of fact, their contempt
for any consideration of things commercial is
the sign-board finger pointing to their eventual
elimination. It was the miracle of all time when
those noble families responded to the necessity of
the new order, forced upon Japan by the outside
world, and gave up their feudal right to the land
to the Emperor for a more democratic distribution.
They not only surrendered their land in response
to the Emperor’s edict, but they metamorphosed
their sons into statesmen to help carry
through the ideal. Their children went to foreign
lands and laboured at menial tasks to learn the
ways of the <i lang="ja">seiyo-jin</i>. Returning home they recognized
that the standards both of commerce and
ordinary trade had to be raised. Their encouragement
to their country to proceed along new
lines was practical and effective; nevertheless few
were the sons of the nobility who themselves entered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the world of commerce. Rather was it that
they encouraged a middle class to rise. Even
with no longer a perpetuation of power through
landed estates, the old aristocracy has so far
continued to exert the preponderating influence
in national leadership. Can they continue to
cherish a contempt of money and at the same
time withstand the power of the new commercial
class which is becoming richer every year while
they are becoming poorer? Can they prove that,
even in this age, honour and loyalty need not have
to go hand in hand with money, and that poverty,
second only to death, is not the great leveller?</p>
<p>Curiously, indeed, the abandon which comes
from contempt for wealth by this class in Japan
has had a bullish effect in one small department
of world trade. Westerners first thought of
Japan as a nation so given over to aestheticism
that it used its hours in creating beautiful works
of art and then admiring them. In those early
days examples of their highest achievement in art
were to be found at incredibly low prices. For
a decade or two after its ports were forced open
by the foreigner, the country was absorbed in
adjusting itself to meet conditions unique to its
traditions. It was a revolution which had to endure
the strain of the uncompromising lavishness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of war without the excitement of war. In such
a period “priceless” art objects had their price.
Those objects of art had been so intimately associated
with the calm of the old order in its
social and religious system that when that order
gave ground the Japanese disregarded such possessions.
It was then that gold lacquer boxes
were either sold for a sum equal to the mere
salvage of the gold or else melted in the furnace.</p>
<p>Those first years of readjustment presented the
glorious days for the foreign collector. Then
came reaction. To their own bewilderment the
Japanese awoke to find that their love for the
beautiful had not been merely an appendage of
the feudal system. They began to compete for
their own treasures. Prices began to advance to
the mystification of the foreign buyers. The Japanese
aristocrats were entering into collecting with
that abandon which can exist only through sincere
contempt for money. Thus it is that very few
fine things now come out of Japan. Japan is
poor, desperately poor, and it would seem that our
millionaires should easily outbid them, but to a
mind commercially trained, eventually there enters
a consideration of price. To the son of the old
Japanese nobility there is no such consideration
except the limit of his purse. I heard the story<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of a young nobleman who desired a certain Korean
antique. His wealth was about six hundred
thousand <i lang="ja">yen</i>. Like the Roman youth who shook
dice, hazarding himself to become the slave of his
opponent should he lose, this young Japanese entered
the bidding until it was his last <i lang="ja">yen</i> which
bought the antiquity. The dilettante does not
bid successfully against that spirit.</p>

<h2>VIII<br>
<span class="titlefont">MANY QUERIES</span></h2>
<p>In abrupt change as we neared Shiogiri the
people grew more prosperous and more smiling.
One housewife along the way was busy with a
gigantic baking in the sun. I have forgotten just
what she said the small cakes were which she was
patting out so expeditiously by the hundred.
Her hands coquettishly fell into error in her routine
when we wished her good-day. She had
an adventurous spirit behind the work-a-day
masque of her face. Inordinate questioners as
we could generally prove ourselves, it was she
who took and kept the lead in every kind of interrogation.
She wanted to know all about the great
world over the ridge of mountains which stopped
her sight. She followed this questioning with an
exposition of facts which she already knew about
foreigners. She could be quite sure, she said,
that the information which she had previously
collected through gossip had in no way been adulterated
by exaggeration. The proof was that
we looked exactly as she had hitherto imagined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
foreigners. This comment was more interesting
than flattering. Her anecdotes about foreigners
were fluently parallel to the tales about pagans
which I used to hear as a child from the cook
when she returned from her missionary circle.</p>
<p>I asked our hostess if she would let me take her
picture. My hesitation in asking was an unnecessary
contribution to the proceedings. She was
much pleased. She patted down her hair, rubbed
her cheeks with a pale blue towel until they were
rosy red, and then dusted her hands and arms
with rice powder. After that she ran into the
house to reappear without her trousers. Hori
told her quickly that foreigners are greatly
shocked to see women in skirts. We appropriately
pretended to be unseeing long enough for
the hasty redonning of the discarded trousers and
then the camera clicked.</p>
<p>Foreigners, particularly missionaries, are by no
means unknown in the quarter of Shiogiri built
around the railway station. The town is a rather
important junction. At the new inn the servants
who met us at the door told us that they knew
just what the foreigner likes. We in our obstinacy
refused to like what the foreigners who
had come before us had said that they liked. It
was one of the least happy of all our rests.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>
<p>The service in the shiny new inn had lost the
spontaneity, the not-to-be-imitated bloom of the
<i lang="ja">yado-ya</i> which makes each guest believe that he is
the most honoured. It had resolved into the
inevitable mortification which comes from trying
to please two masters. When they asked whether
we wished native dishes or foreign dishes for
dinner, we kept insisting that we wished Japanese
fare, but the inn could not shake itself free from
compromises and we had a native dinner cooked
after some imagined foreign style; just as we
would have had a semblance of a foreign dinner
cooked in the native pots if we had consented to
act our proper parts as <i lang="ja">seiyo-jins</i>. The trouble
with such in-between places is not so much that
they are jerry-built or that the ignorance of <em>why</em>
is naturally followed by an ignorance of <em>how</em>, but
that something essentially vital has been abstracted;
the fire has gone, and the result is a
listless lassitude.</p>
<p>Across the street was the entrance to another
inn, with an electric sign at the gate and with
two rows of paper lanterns hanging over the
path. While we were taking a walk and looking
in at the shops Hori picked up the information
from someone that the rival establishment to ours
was half inn, half <i lang="ja">geisha</i> house, that the maids, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
fact, were country <i lang="ja">geishas</i>. Every <i lang="ja">geisha</i> must
have a <i lang="ja">geisha’s</i> ticket from the government to follow
her vocation of innocent amusing. All <i lang="ja">geishas</i>
are not innocent, but says the government, if
they are not they must possess another license.
Through its varieties and grade of licenses the
government relies largely upon maintaining order;
thus, much of the work of the police is devoted to
social regulation to prevent disorder rather than
to the otherwise necessity of curbing it after it
breaks forth. In any social system, whether the
general scheme reaches out for the ideal or not,
if the cogs fit in smoothly enough to work at all,
the logical conclusion reads that the better the
machine runs the more nearly have the everyday,
actual wishes of the people been satisfied. In
Japan the social regulations and the demands of
the popular moral standard appear to mesh without
much friction. This does not mean that the
social problem has been solved, but it does mean
that the compromise has measurably been made
with eyes open and thus some evils have been successfully
eliminated.</p>
<p>The <i lang="ja">geisha</i> tea-houses have their special licenses,
and inns have special licenses. While many combinations
of licenses are possible, it is contrary to
custom to issue a permit to a <i lang="ja">geisha</i> house to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
all the privileges of an inn. Hori thought that
there might be licenses of that sort issued in the
smaller provincial towns such as Shiogiri. Whatever
the facts were, such a combination license
would seem to be contrary to the usual intent of
the regulations. The government proceeds about
its business of regulation without much sentiment,
but it does seek by its very system of labelling to
secure to the innocent the assurance of travelling
through the kingdom without unwittingly having
to come into contact with vice. The traveller is
supposed to be able to go to an inn without having
to inquire whether it is also a questionable
tea-house.</p>
<p>It might seem that the easiest way to have
found out what was the exact status of the inn
across the street would have been to have walked
there and asked. Hori, however, was lukewarm
for any such investigation. I discovered in this
mood of Hori’s cosmos a trait more interesting
than the entire subject of licenses. The intuition
came suddenly in a wholeness. This trait might
have been called patriotic, a patriotism so very
broad that in the first inkling it seemed narrow.
He had a deep desire that we should understand
Japanese ideals, and his process of thought was
that while he believed that to understand Japan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
we must see everything, nevertheless at all times
there should be a certain normality in the seeing.
As he explained, many Japanese customs and
modes of thought, puzzling at first, are quite
comprehensible when the entire fabric is examined.
He did not wish to have certain squares of the
embroidery held up to be criticized without the
offset of properly contrasting squares. Naturally
his own impetus often carried him a little beyond
that normal into looking for the bright and golden
patches and ignoring the dull ones. I think he
was theoretically right, but most of us have a
childish overconfidence in our maturity and we
do not wish to have it doubted that we are
capable observers even of the abnormal. Experience
has not trained us to follow, even if we
wished, an idealized instruction. Thus I am afraid
that O-Owre-san and I remained recalcitrant
observers most of the time and in our own way
used our philosophical microscopes in grandiose
attempt to disintegrate the atom and conclude
the infinite.</p>
<p>It is true that the most balanced mind can be
poisoned by an impression. We are sensitized
to light and shade. The traveller who goes to
one of the great capitals of the world and endures
as his first impression a visit to the dregs of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
underworld forever finds the darkness of that
shadow over his concept of aught else. This comparison
is indeed putting a superlative exaggeration
upon Hori’s not wishing to go to the inn-tea-house
across the street. Just because I happened
to glean something of his attitude about our
excursion as a whole from that particular incident
did not mean that he was attaching particular
importance to it. The subject was dropped
and as we were all tired, we went to bed, and allowed
the double row of paper lanterns to swing
on in the breeze without our three figures casting
shadows on the path beneath, and the question
that interested me about what sort of a license
had been issued there was never settled.</p>
<p>The next morning O-Owre-san and I were off
at an early hour, leaving Hori to follow on the
bicycle. The heavy dew had clotted the dust
and the cobwebs were glistening. It was so cold
that we fell into our fastest gait, but perversely
the town kept creating some new and picturesque
allurement to slow our stride at almost every
pace. Many of the most important houses had
the dignity of villas. I suppose the owners of
those houses look upon the town’s activity as a
railway junction not as a crowning glory but
as a deplorable disturbance. Before the railroad<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
was dreamed of, Japan’s aristocracy had cherished
that particular hillside overlooking the view of
the valley with the snow ridges beyond. The
prosperous shopkeeping streets were busy even
at our early hour; boys and girls were flushing
the pavements, fanning out the water from
wooden dippers; the fathers were taking down
the shutters; and the mothers were giving indiscriminate
directions while they rubbed their eyes
and pulled their <i lang="ja">kimonos</i> straight. Many greeted
us with a cheery “<i lang="ja">O-hayo</i>.”</p>
<p>At the edge of the town a temple gate stood
invitingly open and we entered the garden and
crossed a diminutive bridge to an island. We sat
down to listen to the birds, admire the butterflies,
and watch the gold and silver fish bob out of the
water. The silent temple, hidden in the shadows
of the trees, was built after the noble lines of the
Kyoto tradition and may have been contemporary
with that era. We were waiting for Hori. We
knew that we had several intricate turnings before
we should come to our mountain road to
Kama-Suwa, and we were indulging ourselves
that morning in unwonted conservatism over the
possibility of a mistake. We sat for some time
waiting to hear the jangling of the bicycle bell,
but as no such sound came from the distance and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
as the sun had not warmed the air, we decided to
take the most attractive turns that came, right or
wrong. The street that intrigued our fancy
wound delightfully between large country houses.
While there was nothing except the trees and a
certain pervading atmosphere to suggest the
English country, nevertheless there was the instinctive
feeling that within those screened, luxurious
houses the sleeping families were quality
folk, a class never forgetting that their position
carries responsibilities, duties, and privileges. To
meet a panting coolie dragging a ’ricksha along
an English lane would strike one not only as
strange but ridiculous. To have seen a gate open
that morning in the outskirts of Shiogiri and
to have had a shining British dogcart swing out
into the road atop the heels of a cob would have
seemed neither incongruous nor absurd. That’s
the reward the English achieve from their devout
worship of the correct. In any corner
of the globe when the beholder finds people
getting serious about form, his mind immediately
institutes a comparison with the British
standard.</p>

<img alt="" height="468" src="./The Project Gutenberg eBook of Samurai Trails, by Lucian Swift Kirtland._files/i179.jpg" width="600" id="id-1751732694650460059">
<div class="caption" id="ebm_caption6"><p>WE DECIDED TO TAKE THE MOST ATTRACTIVE TURN, RIGHT OR WRONG</p></div>
</div>
<p>We walked on into a maze of hills. In the
age of chaos the mountain range had tried to
turn to the south but, meeting some powerful opposition,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
had been rolled back over on itself.
When we came to the meeting of a half-dozen
crooked paths there was no possible guess for
our direction. We sat down in the sun for a few
minutes, allowing that much time to good fortune
to send us help, if the god of luck should so
wish to aid, before attempting anything on our
own initiative. We were sent two farmers whom
we almost lost through their sudden surprise upon
seeing us spring up out of the bowels of the earth.
However, they had only been startled, and they
did not think we were transformed demons. They
entered into an energetic discussion of our route,
insisting that we take the trail which was the
faintest of all and which seemingly wandered off
in the most irresponsible way. It first crossed a
footbridge over the stream. One of the men
dug a map in the dust with his toe. We finally
parted with bows and protestations of gratitude
and they stood in the valley and directed us on
our climb as long as we could see them. Then
they waved a final adieu and started on their own
path.</p>
<p>It was decidedly a short cut they had disclosed.
When we were on a summit we discovered Hori
far below wheeling over the long valley road and
undoubtedly wondering why he did not overtake<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
us. Probably a ’ricksha could get through those
hills by keeping to the lower paths, but neither
our generation nor that of our children’s children
will find those narrow trails made over into
motor highways. For generations the tramper will
have his “unspoiled” Japan. It is true that
east to west the mountains have been pierced by
two lines of railway and the foot trails sometimes
cross the steel, but now that the railroads have
been built the trains running through the valleys
and plunging into the tunnels seem to be as alien
to, as outside the lives of the mountain folk, and
as little considered in their existence as the invisible
messages hastening along the telegraph
wires. Japan has been opened to the world and
science has brought an infinite change to the
Japan that we think of, but over those mountain
paths long lines of coolies stagger with their loads
of merchandise as did they in the days before
wheels were invented. Many of the coolies are
women and girls. Over the steep miles the backs
of the little girls are bent under chests which,
thrown to the ground, would be large enough for
playhouses. I know nowhere else in the world
where faces do not grow stolid and stupid under
such strain, but these women and little girls often
turn upon you faces not only pretty but even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
strangely beautiful as they raise their heads for a
quick glance. Their wistful eyes ask unanswerable
questions. You feel as if they were eternally
pondering the <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>I do not mean that such glimpses can bring
more than a merest intuition of a people’s attitude
toward life. Such a gossamer web of intuition
is a personal speculation, but it may be not
too presumptuous for foreign eyes to make a
diagnostic examination of physical characteristics
and to believe that some truth may be reached
from accumulated observations. While the Japanese
nation is old in history and civilization,
and while time’s hammer has made the people as
nearly homogeneous as is synthetically possible,
nevertheless their predominant physical characteristic
is that as a race they are youthful in vitality.
The coolie bends his shoulders to as heavy a load
as he can carry, but also does the coolie of Southern
India. Existence seems to offer not much more
in prizes to one than the other beyond the promise
of the opportunity to labour day after day until
death, but in the Indian’s face one reads that the
draught of unquestioning acceptance of fate was
drunk by his fathers ages ago. That strong arch
of the Japanese jaw means <em>future</em>. The struggle
among nations for dictatorship may end in competition’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
giving the award to the people having
the best teeth.</p>
<p>We passed two or three lonely, terraced farms
where the earth was being coaxed and coddled not
to run away, but through most of the hours of the
climb the mountain sides were a forest reservation
serving as a reservoir to save the water of the
streams for the lower valleys. When we came to
a spring gushing from the hill we drank, an action
which is sternly warned against, and probably
with absolute justification. However, with a
four-mile-an-hour pace under the July sun thirst
becomes positive. We mixed into the clear water,
against any lurking germs, the antidote of deciding
to consider ourselves immune. After a time
our trail brought us down again into the valley,
and it was not until then that Hori caught up
with us although he had been circling around the
base of the hills at full speed. He found us
locked in a bargaining struggle with a gooseberry
peddler. The man was carrying his produce in
a bucket swung at one end of a yoke across his
shoulders, and his pensive little daughter was
balancing the load by sitting in the other bucket.
Our first advances had unutterably confused his
wits, beginning with the logical wonderment why
two pedestrians miles from any town should wish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
to buy green gooseberries. As the bargaining
continued his puzzlement was relieved by a sudden
lightning suspicion. We were not buying gooseberries,
we were trying to buy his daughter! It
seemed so discourteous to rob him of his hard
thought out solution that I urged O-Owre-san
strongly to adopt the child and carry her off in
his rucksack. It was just then that Hori arrived.
He jerked the demon bicycle to a stop and vaulted
to the ground. At first he was as uncomprehending
of why we wished to load up with green
gooseberries as had been the peddler, but that
night he fully acknowledged the value of our
whim when the berries, stewed in sugar, stood
before him.</p>
<p>I had taken the camera out of my pack but
the man was most suspicious of it. We compromised
that I should stand up and show just
what taking a picture was. As soon as I made
the demonstration his quick refusal against such
devil’s work followed. Quite by chance the camera
had clicked during the demonstration.</p>
<p>April-like showers had been tumbling upon us
now and again without disturbing the sunshine.
We had one more long climb and then found ourselves
with Lake Suwa far below. The town
of Kama-suwa rested on the farther shore of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
lake in a narrow line of houses. Despite the
rain flurries the day seemed very clear, but we
did not have the famous first view of O-Fuji-san
which sometimes gloriously greets the traveller
when he stands, as did we, suddenly on the heights
above the lake. On those rare days the mountain
rises against the blue sky, the vista coming through
a sharp gap in the granite hills, and casts its
image on the grey-blue waters. This is the view
from the north. The conventional view is from
the south, but the sacred mountain lessens never
in beauty as the worshipper circles the paths about
its base, north, south, east, or west. Like a
glorious and beautiful soul, its moods change
while it changes not.</p>
<p>Is it idolatrous to worship Fuji? Is it pagan
to love its beauty, to feel one’s spirit freed for
a brief moment, forgetful of experience tugging
at one’s elbow, of caution, of fear, of expediency,
of pride?</p>

<h2>IX<br>
<span class="titlefont">THE INN AT KAMA-SUWA</span></h2>
<p>The railway train with its sly befuddling
through the luxury of speed has picked the traveller’s
wallet. Cooped behind a smudged window,
how can he sense the personality of the town he
enters? One should stand in isolation on the
heights above a city, and then follow down some
path until within the streets one is absorbed by
the throbbing life. (Hobo Jack, <i lang="la">ipse dixit</i>. And
is this not true?)</p>
<p>To appreciate Kama-Suwa’s surcharge of culture,
prosperity, and importance, the reader should
think of a small city in Kansas (one of those
temperate, prosperous, ideal cities of which one
has a vividly exact idea without the proof or
disproof from having visited it). I say this,
knowing only the standardized impression of
those ideal cities, but often a common, standardized
impression may be more expeditious, not
to say more valuable, or even more truthful, to
communicate a comparison than the truth itself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Thus, by such a comparison let Kama-Suwa be
known.</p>
<p>The Kama-Suwa streets are filled with good
citizens; the shops are superior, the town has
“as fine a school system as you could find anywhere”;
the temple is “well supported”; and
there are not any very poor people. Also the
town has famous hot springs and famous views.
In the age when Nature was distributing her
gifts she favoured Suwa with excessive partiality,
in anticipation, perhaps, of the future births of
to-day’s appreciative, virtuous, honest, and industrious
Kama-Suwans.</p>
<p>We had had a good report of a certain inn in
the town and, after we reached the path around
the shore, Hori went ahead on the bicycle to
prepare the way. The machine’s parts were
working together with remarkable smoothness that
day, perhaps because its superfluous temper had
been cooled down through its having been left
out in a short, hard beating rain while we were
taking refuge under a tree. We promised Hori
to hurry, but we did not. The mountains overhanging
the lake were responsible in the beginning
for our forgetting our word, but we augmented
that beginning by finding some cause for
a violent argument, one of those tempestuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
discussions which gain their heat from the insidious
conceding of small points. An obstinate,
unyielding opponent who stays put is a far more
satisfactory antagonist. We were well into the
town before we discovered that we were hemmed
in by houses. The interruption which opened our
eyes was a polite pulling at our sleeves. One
waylayer, out of the many who had surrounded
us, had cast away in despair the usual Japanese
respect for not touching the person.</p>
<p>Why our entry had created such excess of
excitement we could not imagine. We had grown
<i lang="fr">blasé</i> in our role of being interesting exhibits.
One may even grow so accustomed to having an
interest taken in every detail that a lack of
acknowledgment of curiosity seems the abnormal.
This time mere curiosity did not appear to be
the factor. Each waylayer was trying to speak.
In the confusion I could not catch one familiar
word. I knew most of the names that are sometimes
cried at foreigners in the port cities, but
there was nothing hostile in the present attack.
As a sedative I tried to ask the way to the inn
but my simple question increased the babel. We
had no answer that we could understand. We had
been smiling and bearing the mystery, and there
was no choice but to continue so doing. Every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
shopkeeper in the street was apparently out now,
helping to gesticulate if not to add words. We
had continued walking and we came to an open
space. All the brown hands simultaneously
pointed in a dramatic sweep across a swampy
field. On the roof of a large, new building stood
Kenjiro Hori. He had changed into a <i lang="ja">kimono</i>
which he was modestly trying to hold around him
in the freshening breeze and at the same time
to wave a huge white sheet with all the energy
of his other wiry arm.</p>
<p>When we reached the door Hori had come
down from the roof. He was very expeditious
in his instructions to the servants and our shoes
were off and we were in our room before we
had a chance to ask a question.</p>
<p>“Now that we’re <em>settled</em>——” Hori began with
a slight accent on the “settled.” He then hesitated.</p>
<p>“Yes?” we inquired.</p>
<p>“Oh, I was just going to ask whether you
wouldn’t rather dry your clothes and take a bath
before we go exploring around the town.”</p>
<p>As O-Owre-san had been answering that question
by hanging up his wet clothes and getting
into a cotton <i lang="ja">kimono</i>, it did not seem to require
argument.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>
<p>“Is the bath ready?” he asked.</p>
<p>“It’s always ready—natural hot springs,” Hori
answered.</p>
<p>I stacked up some cushions and stretched out
in comfort along the balcony. I sipped tea and
smoked until I was sure O-Owre-san would not
be returning for something forgotten. I had been
suspecting that Hori’s nonchalance had clay feet.</p>
<p>“O-Hori-san,” I asked, “what did you say
was the name of this inn?”</p>
<p>O-Owre-san was always off to the bath as soon
as his feet were inside an inn. This time I had
marvelled that the habit was so strong that he
could put off attempting to solve the mystery
of our reception, especially as Hori’s naïve casualness
suggested that he knew the kernel of the
mystery.</p>
<p>“It’s a new inn. Very good, don’t you think?”
Hori answered my question.</p>
<p>“What is the secret?” I demanded. It was
evidently very dark and if the facts had to be
modified in the telling, I thought that perhaps
they might come forth less modified for me than
for O-Owre-san. The other inn had been one
of our few planned quests. “Why didn’t we
go to the other inn?”</p>
<p>It may have been most unfair to use such a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
direct method of questioning, especially the distressing,
bee-line “hurry-up.” I was trading
upon my being a foreigner from a land without
the tradition of the proper ceremony of questions.</p>
<p>Yes, Hori had visited the inn of which we had
had the superior report. It was a most superior
place. He paused. Then he vouchsafed the information
that it was expensive. That was indeed
a serious objection. He thought that the bill
there might have come to three, four, or even five
<i lang="ja">yen</i> a day. That explanation should have been
final enough for me. It was, in fact. I would
have accepted it. I merely happened to ask
whether he had looked at the rooms.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said he, and then he suddenly threw
discretion away. “And what do you think?
<em>They had rocking-chairs and American bureaus
in the rooms.</em>”</p>
<p>Poor Hori! He had been having to listen
to us inveigh in American exaggeration against
the infamous inroads of modernity. I cannot
imagine that he took our chants of hatred against
innovations actually at their word value, but he
had had much reason to become weary and bored
from their repetition. He implied that his reason
for leaving the other inn was for our aesthetic
protection, but be it said he was wise in his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
protection. There is not much doubt that if we
had reached the presence of those rooms there
would have been another merry-to-do of wild
epithets against machine-made American export
furniture bespoiling native simplicity for him to
listen to. The tourist animal is truly a snobbish
beast, and natives should occasionally be given
dispensations for outright murder.</p>
<p>Once I was chatting over tall iced lemon
squashes with a Japanese physician. In a surge
of confidence, and also in burning curiosity, he
told me about his trip to America. He had
learned his English in Japan. While visiting a
family whom he had known in his homeland, he
met one of America’s daughters who asked him
to call. He was somewhat startled by the invitation
but he remembered that he was not in the
Orient. He described the conversation to me in
awed phrases.</p>
<p>“She had a box of chocolates. ‘Do you
know,’ she said, ‘I am mad about chocolates,
simply crazy.’</p>
<p>“I thought,” he explained, “that she was confessing
to a craving appetite and wished my
assistance and advice. I imagined, then, that I
knew the reason of my invitation. I was a
physician from a foreign land and, as I must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
soon return to my own country, her secret with
me would be as good as buried. I explained
that I could do nothing for her without the full
confidence of her father and mother. She took
this natural suggestion as if it were meant to
be humorous. When she had stopped laughing
she told me that the Japanese are perfect dears
and horribly cute. Then she asked me if I didn’t
love—what was it she asked me that I loved?
I forget. You see we Japanese have few words
to express the affections and use those sparingly.
And now,” he leaned eagerly forward, “I want
to ask you whether that young lady was charming?”</p>
<p>I tried to evade by asking him what was his
idea of charming.</p>
<p>“That’s just what I don’t know. I was told
that she was beautiful and charming. I could
see that she was beautiful. Then I asked people
what charming meant. They all told me something
different.”</p>
<p>“You can’t define charming,” I hazarded.
“It’s something different from a mere attribute.
Foreigners always say that Japanese women are
charming.”</p>
<p>“Then she wasn’t charming,” he decided judicially.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>
<p>Several times I have been so rash as to try
to explain to men of other nations how much
an ordinary American conversation should be discounted.
I fear that they did not accept my
formula but held to the extremes, either continuing
to take us literally or not believing us
at all.</p>
<p>After Hori had discovered the untoward action
of the first inn in adding rocking-chairs and
bureaus to its equipment, he hurried down the
street and warned the shopkeepers whom he could
find to stop any two wandering <i lang="ja">seiyo-jins</i> and
direct their attention to the new inn. They must
have been impressed that the affair was one of
moment.</p>
<p>We heard O-Owre-san, the feared critic of
varnished, golden-oak-pine bureaus, coming up
the stairs. A striped, blue <i lang="ja">kimono</i> made in
Japanese standard length somehow does not suggest
dignity when worn by a more than six-foot
foreigner with a beard, but O-Owre-san came so
solemnly across the mats in his bare feet that his
ominous repression created its own aura of dignity.
Something had happened, but he was not
inviting questions.</p>
<p>Hori started in turn for his bath. I remained
on my cushions. I sat and sipped my tea.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
O-Owre-san sat and sipped his tea. Hori with
his secret of the rocking-chair inn had not been
impregnable to questions. O-Owre-san was too
dangerously calm. I waited.</p>
<p>He began by alluding to the excellence of the
rooms we had. They were excellent, the best
in the inn, being a part of an extra cupola story
and giving a splendid view across the lake. Then
he restated the known fact that the baths were
served by natural hot springs. “The water
comes pouring in through bamboo pipes,” he said.</p>
<p>“Well,” I spoke for the first time, “and then
what happened?”</p>
<p>The honourable <i lang="ja">seiyo-jin</i> drank another cup
of tea.</p>
<p>“I got into the wrong bath,” he said.</p>
<p>It was news that there could be any such thing
as a wrong bath in a Japanese inn.</p>
<p>“You see,” he continued, “the baths for the
guests of the inn are just under us, but I didn’t
notice them when I walked by. When I got to
the other end of the hall I found a large bath
room. Those are the public baths, but I didn’t
know that then. There were several big tubs
with the water tumbling in all the time from the
pipes. There was nobody else there nor a sign
of anybody. I made myself at home and was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
floating in one of the tubs when suddenly I heard
a monstrous chattering out in the hall and then
right into the room walked twenty girls. Maybe
there were twice that many. I don’t know.
Well, I’ve called upon my practical philosophy
to recognize the extenuating virtues of—ah—the
natural simplicity of the traditional exposure of
the Japanese bath—so to speak—its insecurity—as
it were—but—but—h’m—yes—but this was too
much.”</p>
<p>I shouted.</p>
<p>He glared.</p>
<p>“I was just thinking——” I tried to say.</p>
<p>“I can see you are just thinking,” he interrupted,
“and I know what you are thinking.
You are thinking what a great story this will be
to tell when we get home. Believe me, if you
ever do——”</p>
<p>“How could you ever imagine such treachery?”
I wedged in.</p>
<p>“Well, and then what was I to do?” he demanded.
“I couldn’t jump out and run and
I couldn’t stay in that boiling water until I was
cooked. I relied upon some instinct of feminine
chivalry to give me a chance, but——”</p>
<p>I tried to be sympathetically consoling. “A
very, very trying situation.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>
<p>“Huh! They were all stepping in and they
just naturally crowded me out. Of course they
paid absolutely no attention——”</p>
<p>Hori’s step was on the stair. He came in and
sat down and poured a cup of tea. Then he
stretched out on his back and gazed innocently
at the ceiling. “O-Doctor-san,” he said, “you’ve
settled a disputed point in Kama-Suwa and everybody’s
much obliged.”</p>

<h2>X<br>
<span class="titlefont">THE GUEST OF THE OTHER TOWER ROOM</span></h2>
<p>Our tower wing of the inn at Kama-Suwa
had required no architectural ingenuity in its
design, but I do not remember ever having seen
a Japanese building planned in the same way.
The walls were open on the four sides and there
was no <i lang="ja">takemono</i> corner. The only approach
was by a flight of stairs which belonged to it
exclusively. We thus had an isolation most unusual.
It mattered not the length and breadth
of the space given us, our few possessions were
always scattered over all the space available.</p>
<p>We heard steps on the stair and our hostess
and a maid came up to us and bowed many
times and brought many apologies. Half our
space was to be taken away. This was only
following the very equitable custom that a guest
may have all of the extension of his floor until
some other traveller must be accommodated, and
then, presto! there are two rooms where one was
before.</p>
<p>In a few minutes a double row of screens had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
been pushed along the grooved slides in the floor
from the head of the stairs, creating two complete
rooms with a hallway between. The new
guest, a woman, stood waiting to take possession.
From the quality of her <i lang="ja">kimono</i>, the refinement
of her face, and the arrangement of her hair, we
could judge that she was of superior rank. We
questioned with some wonder why she was alone,
but as it was extremely unlikely that that question
or any other about her would be answered, the
passing query was dismissed. However, it came
about that we were to know one poignant chapter
in that woman’s life.</p>
<p>We went exploring to find the kitchen, there
to deliver our gooseberries and our recipe. The
maids and cooks stood and listened. We proceeded
with our explanation until we reached the
point where one more suppressed giggle on the
part of the <i lang="ja">ne-sans</i> might have burst forth into
full hysterics. We released them in time by
laughing ourselves and then left them to recover
as best they could and to experiment with the
stewing. Their irresponsible laughing for laughter’s
sake had infected us with the mood. We
went filing back to our room. The guest of the
second tower room was standing on the balcony
at the head of the stairs. She had changed from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
her street <i lang="ja">kimono</i>. Her eyes were shaded by
her hand and she was looking searchingly down
the road. As we walked by she stepped a little
farther out on the narrow balcony but did not
take her eyes from her quest.</p>
<p>The maid brought our dinner. It had been
fourteen hours since breakfast and we had been
tramping mountain paths, but without the sauce
of appetite that dinner could have justified its
existence. There were fish fresh from the mountain
waters of the lake, and there were grilled
eels, and there were strange vegetables with
strange sauces. When the rice came we poured
our stewed gooseberry juice over the bowl. The
maid had left the screen pushed back when she
carried off the tables downstairs. At that moment
of our contentment I looked up to see the
lonely watcher step back from the balcony. Her
expression had changed to joyful expectancy and
radiant relief and trust. She went to her room,
then returned to the balcony, then ran again to
her room. In a moment or two the round, sleepy
maid stumbled up the stairs and whispered a
message. The message again brought the woman
to the head of the stairs and in a moment we
could hear a man’s step coming.</p>
<p>The greeting of affection in Japan is not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
meeting of the lips. Whatever the proper cherishing
expression may be, it cannot be such a
casual acknowledgment as was that man’s indifferent
greeting in the inn at Kama-Suwa. A
glance showed that he belonged to that new type
which modern Japan has produced, the mobile,
keen, aggressive, calculating, successful man of
business and affairs. He was about thirty-five.
Men of this new stamp are seldom met with in
the provinces where the old order has changed
so little but in Tokyo and the port cities their
ideas are the predominant influence. Their aggression
and ability have taken over the business
and industries which the foreigner established.
When one thinks of Old Japan one can believe
that the thought action of this type of man by
the very virtue of his being understood by us
is enigma to those who still seek their inspiration
in the ideals of the order that was.</p>
<p>“Well, I am here,” he said. “You sent for
me and I came.”</p>
<p>The woman stood, making no answer.</p>
<p>“What’s it all about?” he went on. “Your
message was very mysterious. It cannot be that
you have been so foolish—so unthinking—as absolutely
to make a break with your husband?”</p>
<p>“You are tired from your trip,” she said.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
“Come! Sit down! Your dinner is waiting to
be brought.”</p>
<p>He sat down and the woman clapped her hands
for the maid. When the stumbling, awkward
girl came the man changed the order and told
the <i lang="ja">ne-san</i> to bring <i lang="ja">sake</i> first of all. He sat in
silence until the hot rice wine came. He drank
several of the small cups. Then the maid brought
the lacquer tables with the dinner dishes. The
man lifted up one or two covers and then suddenly
jumped to his feet and declared that he
was going to take a bath.</p>
<p>The maid led the way to the large room for
baths which was just under our rooms. The
woman sat before her untasted dinner. Soon
there was a sound of laughing and chattering
from below. There was the man’s voice and the
maid’s laugh. Finally the woman arose, walked
out into the hall, tentatively put a foot on the
stair, then slowly walked down. She waited outside
the sliding paper door. The maid had committed
no breach against custom in lingering idly
after carrying in towels and brushes. It was
for no personal bitterness against the stupid maid
that tears had gathered in the woman’s eyes.
There was nothing vulgar in the words of the
bantering chatter she heard. It was the fact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
that the man was accepting the moment so carelessly,
so unfeelingly for her anguish, knowing
as he must unquestionably that every word of
his indifferent greeting to her had carried a torturing
thrust of pain.</p>
<p>The dinner was brought up again, warmed
over. We heard the order for another bottle
of <i lang="ja">sake</i>. We could not escape hearing through
the paper wall. We had intended taking a walk
but a misty rain had come down. The mosquitoes
arose from the beaches of the lake. We
sent for the maid and asked for the beds and
mosquito netting. In the meantime Hori and
I were tempted into taking another luxurious
sinking into the hot baths. O-Owre-san had
turned out the light before we came back. In
the darkness we crawled carefully under the omnibus
netting and I went to sleep immediately. I
awoke in about an hour. The misty rain had
been blown away and the moon was shining so
clearly that when I turned over I could see that
Hori’s eyes were wide open. I heard the maid,
stumbling as always, come up the stairs with
another bottle of <i lang="ja">sake</i>. I asked Hori whether
he had been asleep. He said that he had not,
that after the woman had begun talking she had
not stopped. I could hear her low, ceaseless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
tones. The man was smoking one pipe after
another. He would knock out the ash against
the brazier—four staccato raps—then there would
be a pause for the three or four puffs from the
refilled pipe, and then the staccato raps again.</p>
<p>“If we are ever going to get to sleep,” said
Hori, “we’ll have to complain to the mistress.
Guests haven’t any right to keep other guests
awake.”</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t it be better to make some
such suggestion to them without calling in the
mistress?” I asked.</p>
<p>Hori shook his head. That was not the way.
However, we delayed sending for the inn mistress.
Hori translated some of the conversation that he
had heard before I woke up. The woman had
that morning left her home and her husband.
She had sent a message to the man now in the
room with her, but her news had evidently been
one of his least desired wishes. Before he sank
into the silence of tobacco and <i lang="ja">sake</i> he had said
his disapproval.</p>
<p>“I thought you had more sense than to do
anything so absurd, so almost final. Don’t you
see that it will be almost impossible for you to
go back now? How will you make any explanation
that he can accept?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>
<p>“But,” she interrupted, “I came to you as
you have so often said that you wished I could.
That was the only way I could be even a little
bit fair to him—to leave his house.”</p>
<p>“Everything was all right as it was.”</p>
<p>“No! No! I could not live that way.”</p>
<p>“I can’t see why. I don’t see it. Now you’ve
pretty nearly ruined both of us. However, we’ve
got to think of some way for you to go back.”</p>
<p>“But I can’t. I’ve lost the possibility of that.
If I had not thought you wished me, I might not
have come to you, but I could not stay there.”</p>
<p>“That’s foolishness. Anyhow, you can go to
your own family, and when he finds that is where
you are, he’ll want you to come back.”</p>
<p>Her mind was dully grasping that here, with
this man, she had no refuge, but her heart would
not believe.</p>
<p>“I wished to make it complete,” she repeated.
“I wanted to give up everything for you.”</p>
<p>What folly, what sheer childish folly, he told
her, that she had listened seriously to his idle,
passing phrases. Why, always, she must have
known that he was merely answering her vanity.
Any woman should have known and accepted that.</p>
<p>The ceaseless words and the staccato rapping
of the pipe continued. We dismissed from our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
minds any intention of sending for the mistress,
but not from prying curiosity. Our sleeping, or
our not sleeping, was not of importance. In
merciful pity (at least as we thought) for the
woman, we knew that that contest must be settled
as it was being settled. “But,” Hori whispered,
“it would be a mighty big satisfaction to mix
in a little physical argument.”</p>
<p>“No one at this inn knows who I am,” the
man continued. “No one has any idea that you
have more than the slightest acquaintanceship
with me. No one would ever be convinced that
you ran away to meet me.”</p>
<p>She ceased the argument that she had come
to him in willing sacrifice of all else—the supreme
gift of her love for him. She began to plead.
He did not answer. His pipe struck against the
brazier and now and again the maid brought
<i lang="ja">sake</i>. Once she began to weep hysterically but
this surrender to her agony was only for a short
moment.</p>
<p>It was now almost morning. The rapping of
the pipe stopped. The man got to his feet somewhat
noisily. Passionately and despairingly the
woman begged him not to leave her. Then as
suddenly she ceased all words and said nothing
as he made his preparations for going, nor did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
she call after him when he left her. Her unbeating
breast imprisoned her breath through one
last moment of hope. The spark of faith died
but the torture of life remained, and her breath
was released in a long, low moan. Until morning
broke she sobbed, lying there on the floor.</p>
<p>She had not pushed back the wall panel which
the man had left open. When we went below to
our baths she drew in her outstretched arm which
still reached gropingly into the narrow passageway.
She dressed before we returned. We met
her on the stairs. She started to cover her face
with her <i lang="ja">kimono</i> sleeve, and then, listlessly,
dropped her arm.</p>
<p>“Where will she go?” I asked Hori.</p>
<p>Hori did not know. In the old régime, he
explained, when a woman of the aristocracy left
her husband she went to her family, but it had
been only under extreme duress that a woman
would leave her husband. There is much talk
to-day in Japan that the social institutions are
crumbling. One is told that the “new woman”
movement is a result of the crumbling of the
old order; and again one is told that the crumbling
has come from the new woman movement. These
latter critics say that so many women are leaving
their homes that if any proper discipline is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
be retained and maintained, the tradition that
a woman’s own family may receive her into their
house must be uncompromisingly discouraged as
a declaration of warning to others.</p>
<p>Hori, himself, now that the tragedy had ceased
to be so present, was somewhat inclined to look
upon the history of the night in its relation to
collective society rather than as the drama of two
individuals. A Japanese instinctively regards a
family as a family, and not as a collection of
units. Loyalty is the basic idea of that philosophy
and not the importance of the individual
soul.</p>
<p>“There is one thing quite sure,” he added,
“she was obviously from a sheltered home and
Japanese ladies know precious little about the
realities of the outside world. I don’t believe
you could understand. Why, they don’t even go
shopping like American women. The shopkeepers
bring everything to them. If she hasn’t
some place to go—well, you can guess what will
happen to her. She could never earn her own
living any more than a baby.”</p>
<p>“It may end with suicide,” I suggested.</p>
<p>Hori doubted that. Suicide is an escape often
appealed to in Japan, but he thought that if her
temperament had been impulsively capable of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
seeking such release, she would have made the
attempt immediately.</p>
<p>“But,” I objected, “isn’t your other alternative
impossible? Isn’t there a rigid law that no
woman of the <i lang="ja">samurai</i> class can enter the <i lang="ja">yoshiwara</i>?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” said he, “but an agent can easily
arrange to have her adopted into some family
of a lower order and then she loses her rank and
its protection.”</p>
<p>O-Owre-san came up from his bath and asked
us what we were talking about. He had slept
through the night.</p>

<h2>XI<br>
<span class="titlefont">ANTIQUES, TEMPLES, AND TEACHING CHARM</span></h2>
<p>For many days we had been passing through
villages which yielded no good hunting among
the antique and second-hand shops. It should
be known that the lure of the curio carries poison.
Two friends who have lived blithely in affection,
confident that no brutal nor subtle assault could
ever avail against the harmony of their intimate
understanding, perchance step through the doorway
of a shop. Presto! A candlestick, a vase,
a box, a tumbledown chair, whatever it may be—the
desire for the thing magically energizes perception.
We suddenly and clearly perceive that
the one-time friend at our side is hung with many
false tinkling cymbals. We never break the rules
of the game; it is the friend who always errs.
Thus I was always learning O-Owre-san’s abysmal
depths, while he was encountering my superlative
virtues of unselfishness. However, as his chief
fiendishness was for cloisonné and my interest
was in carved iron and bronzes and old Kyoto<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
ware, we were spared from too many overdoses
of poison.</p>
<p>The little shops of Kama-Suwa really had
curios. There were strange, imaginative odds
and ends which had been made to please the
whims of the eccentrics of a vanished and now
almost un-understandable age. Of such whimsicality
were the costumes and the heap of personal
adornments which we discovered that had once
been fashioned for a famous wrestler of Kama-Suwa.
Even his sandals were there. He must
have been a giant, truly, if his feet filled those
<i lang="ja">geta</i>. Everything for the hero had been made
in faithful exaggeration to many times the size
of the conventional. His leather tobacco pouch
was as big as our rucksacks. Every detail of
the decorations of the pouch, such as the <i lang="ja">netsuke</i>,
was increased to correct proportion. In the
stockings for his feet the threads were as thick
as whipcord. The grain of the shark skin binding
the handle of his sword had come from some
fish of the Brobdingnag world. When fully
equipped, that famous man—they spoke of him
reverently—must have given the effect that he
had been blown into expansion by some marvellous
pump.</p>
<p>After we had shaken a dozen or so curio shops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
through our sieve we wandered off into the rain
seeking the village temple in the hills. By festivals
and gorgeous pageants the people around
the shore of Suwa still celebrate their faith and
belief that its towns were built by the gods in
the beginning of time. The upkeep of the
temples, I suppose, must now come from the
worshippers or the state as there are no longer
lavish feudal patrons with immense incomes of
rice. Nevertheless these temples do not seem to
suffer poverty.</p>
<p>We easily found the path. A spring bursts
from the rock of the precipitous hill back of the
temple garden and its waters keep green the
shrubs and grasses and the bamboo, and cherish
the flowers. Perhaps the garden has achieved
its perfection by minute alterations through hundreds
of years, but its appeal bespeaks the original
conception of its first master artist, who, by
creating a subtle absence of formal arrangement,
offered the supreme compliment to the beholder
to carry on through his own creative imagination
that approach to the ideal perfection which can
never be reached.</p>
<p>After a time the rain, which had begun falling
in torrents, drove us back from the dream garden
to the shelter of the overhanging temple roof.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
A sliding door opened behind us and we turned
around to see an old woman kneeling on the matting.
She bowed low and then arose to disappear
and to return again with tea and rice cakes and
fruit. She placed the dishes on a low, black
lacquer table. We untied our muddy shoes and
moved in onto the mats. The rain fell in dull,
droning monotony on the tiles of the roof far
above our heads; back in the deep shadows our
eyes could see the gleaming of the reddish gold
edges of the lacquered idols. Every suggestion
was hypnotic of sleep and I had been awake
almost all the night before. I grew so sleepy
that even the touch of the cup in my hand had
the feeling of unreal reality. Between the raising
of the cup to my lips and the putting of it
down I actually plunged for an instant into sleep,
then came to consciousness with a start. I looked
at Hori. His eyes were blinking waveringly and
with much uncertainty. Were there ever such
guests of a temple? I vaguely remember that
our hostess put a cushion under my head, and
then came a rhythmic coolness from her fan over
my face. I would have slept on the rack.</p>
<p>We slept until we awoke to find the sun shining.
Our hostess, with immobile, gentle face,
was still fanning us. We were abjectly, guiltily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
remorseful. We sat up and she brought fresh
tea. We appealed in a roundabout way for
forgiveness by praising the teacups and the teapot.
They were very fine. She explained that
they had been the gift of some <i lang="ja">daimyo</i>, she
thought. Whoever he was, he had made many
rich gifts to the temple. She pushed back panels
and brought out bowls and vases, and told us
romantic legends. The legends were colourful
rather than of plot. I knew then that I could
never remember more than their impression. The
old woman’s own personality had drifted into
limbo and she had absorbed in its place a reflection
of those dark, mysterious temple rooms.
She held out robes and porcelains before us and
then carried them away quickly. She led us
through the shadows, stopping to light incense
at the feet of the Buddhas with the reverence
that such acts were her life and not her task.</p>
<p>We said good-bye and walked away, following
along the crest of the hill. The temple roof disappeared
behind the treetops and we were again
in the modern world, for at that instant across
the valley we saw a huge, nondescript, barracks-like
building. It had been erected in the worship
of efficiency, and was more completely mere walls
of windows with a roof above than even an American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
factory. As we stood watching, a man paced
out of the gate and behind him stepped a girl,
and then another girl, and another, until it was
a long procession. The line pursued a twisting
way, sometimes in measured steps, sometimes in
undulating running. At last the line formed a
serpentine coil in an open space.</p>
<p>The building was the high school for girls and
the man leading the line was the physical instructor.
The pupils wore the distinguishing universal
reddish-purple skirt of the high schools
which are bound over the <i lang="ja">kimonos</i>. These skirts
look heavy and uncomfortable. They must have
been designed by some minister of education in
those days of translation when the demand for
modern ideas included always that they must be
served raw. It was believed with loyalty and
devotion that the principle at the base of the
secret of foreign success was the axiom that
nothing useful can be ornamental.</p>
<p>The physical instructor was inhumanly military
and dignified—and so overwhelmingly efficient in
his instruction that it was annoying to see such
perfection. Secretly perhaps, but always, the
male animal instinctively protests and resists that
women should unite into solidarity to do things.
To his roots he begs that if they do so do, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
shall not achieve success in the essay. Man has
always run in packs, but woman has been the
eternal individual. Our wrath was against the
traitor in sleeveless gymnasium shirt and tight
foreign trousers who was teaching so systematically
and effectively to that line of girls the secret
of team work. By the sorrow of his eyes it could
be seen he acknowledged to himself his infamy
to his sex, but his loyalty to his Emperor was
that he must conduct that exercise drill and conduct
it professionally.</p>
<p>Hori suggested that we visit the school, insisting
that such a visit would be considered a great
compliment. It seemed to us more like an impertinence
of vagrants, but Hori continued firm
that it was our duty as itinerant foreigners to
interrupt the machinery. He took a couple of
our visiting cards, mere innocent slips of pasteboard,
and proceeded with his fountain pen to
make them pretentiously formidable. He raked
up all the detritus of our past lives. We did
have sufficiency of conventional shame to cough
apologetically when Hori read aloud the outrageous
qualifications of our scholarship and degrees
which he had added after our names. We
learned that it is a mistake to believe that there
can be no utilitarian value in a college degree:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
letters after one’s name are seeds ready to burst
into useful bloom under an exotic sun, and the
flowering may be a pass into a provincial high
school for Japanese maidens.</p>
<p>A servant took those remarkable cards from
Hori’s hand and walked off down the long corridor.
The result was that a smiling diplomat
came to us empowered to minister to our entertainment
and instruction. We were honoured as
the first courtesy by <em>not</em> being allowed to remove
our heavy walking shoes. Every step that I
took on those shining, spotless floors made me
feel as if I were perpetrating a clownish indecency.
The remorse that follows one’s own wilfulness
can never be so keen as the agony when
sheer fate ordains unavoidable vulgarity. Still,
in leaving heel marks in the polished wood, there
was the saving humour of the idea that our hosts
thought they were honouring us by encouraging
our foreign barbarity.</p>
<p>There were unending rooms of maids in purple
skirts. They were studying every sort of subject
from the abstract to the practical, and from
the aesthetic to the ethical. There were girls with
the refinement of profile which one seeks and
finds in the ideal drawings by the great Japanese
artists; and there were those other faces, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
round, good-natured O-Martha-sans. We looked
over their shoulders at their paintings of flowers,
at their embroidery, at their arithmetic sums, their
maps, and their English composition. The Japanese
say, “Perhaps rich nations can afford to
economize in education and to exploit ignorance,
but we, being very poor, must be practical. We
cannot take such risk of ignorance.”</p>
<p>A modicum of truth lies in the statement that
the Japanese have taken up education as a new
religion. (And some of the bumptious youthful
devotees in Tokyo impress one that it was a
mistaken bargain to have allowed them to exchange
pocket shrines for text-books.) Theories
of education have many splits everywhere in the
world and the Japanese fervour has not escaped
having to face the necessity of certain decisions.
One difference of opinion, which might almost
be called theological, rests in the question whether
the youth should be educated to think according
to conviction or to think according to conformity;
to think or to be taught what to think. A Japanese
told us that the government must risk its
last penny to-day to guarantee the future, that
the people are being educated to understand
national policies in the faith that understanding
will breed willing cooperation and willing self-sacrifice.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
When I asked him which he meant,
whether students were being taught to understand
the policies of the state or whether they
were being taught to believe in them, I rather
thought that he considered my question argumentative
and perhaps unfriendly. However,
without his having answered the question, it is
obvious that Japan is trusting its fate to the
system of educating toward solidarity, the impulse
to think alike.</p>
<p>After our noisy boots had been in and out of
many rooms we were taken to meet the head of
the school. He was not in his administration
room, but he entered in a few minutes. After
the formal introduction he clapped his hands for
tea. His appearance and his dignity were of
ancient Japan. His thin divided moustache fell
in long pencil-like strands from the corners of
his lip, as do those of the sages in the ancient
Chinese paintings. His <i lang="ja">kimono</i> was silk. We
smoked and drank tea and talked abstractedly
about education. It was a girls’ school but he
talked of boys. We strayed from Montessori
methods to industrial training. After he had
used some such phrases as “a sound education,”
O-Owre-san asked how many years of a boy’s
life he considered should be given over to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
schooling. His eyes had been of passive light.
They now gleamed like those of a warrior.</p>
<p>“Until he has been taught loyalty to his Emperor!”</p>
<p>It perhaps may be a debatable question for
the other nations of the world, that question of
Socrates whether virtue can be taught, but the
headmaster of the high school in Kama-Suwa
declared that in Japan a teacher is not a teacher
unless he can teach loyalty. The boys must be
taught loyalty; the daughters of the Empire must
be taught grace. (And by grace I think he
meant also charm.) To exemplify, we were led
to the “flower-arranging room.” The Japanese
arranging of flowers is a ceremony and there is
commingled in it both the suggestion of the actual
in life and the ideal of the perfect. The room
which we were shown was an attempt to achieve
the supreme inheritance of Japanese art in architecture
and decoration—rhythm, harmony, and
simplicity. Something of the spirit of didacticism
must ever hang over a room so built but,
in the room that we were shown, charm and
beauty had surprisingly survived the inevitable
refrigeration of being labelled “classic.”</p>

<h2>XII<br>
<span class="titlefont">TSURO-MATSU AND HISU-MATSU</span></h2>
<p>In the same town of Kama-Suwa where the
barracks-like high school for girls spreads its
wings there also rises the tiled roof of a <i lang="ja">geisha</i>
house. Under its protection other daughters of
the Empire are also being rigorously trained to
duties—the life of amusing and entertaining.
The position of the <i lang="ja">geisha</i> cannot be illuminated
by comparisons. There are the “sing-song girls”
of Peking and the nautch dancers of India, and
there were in the days of the fruition of Greek
civilization the sisters of Aspasia; the life of the
<i lang="ja">geisha</i> might be considered to be somewhat
parallel to their lives in so far as it is a response
to the demand of highly civilized man for the
romance of idealized anarchy; the inhibitions of
custom, or dogma, having precluded the expression
of inborn romantic desire in his conventional
life. Men whose minds have realized some measure
of freedom through imagination and culture
instinctively seek idealistic companionship with
women. When realization is compressed by such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
custom as marriage by family arrangement this
desire finds expression in some direction where
there is at least the illusion of freedom. Human
nature is like the human body, if pressure is
applied in one spot, unless there is some equitable,
compensating bulge elsewhere, the compression is
likely to be vitally destructive. If the highest
ideality has as its cornerstone responsibility, then
when marriage is an institution by arrangement
and the sense of responsibility is not created
through the freedom of choice, feminine companionship
and charm will inevitably be sought
in the romance of some more voluntary arrangement.
Who will absolutely deny that when the
endeavour to save poetical yearning from defeat
is such companionship as the almost classical ceremony
of watching the white fingers of a <i lang="ja">geisha</i>
pour tea into a shell of porcelain, a sort of mutual
sense of responsibility to save the fineness of life
may enter into the relationship as a redeeming
grace against the professionalism of the <i lang="ja">geisha’s</i>
life?</p>
<p>We turned from the street into the gate of
the principal tea-house. There was a clapping
of hands by the first servant who heard our steps
on the gravel path and in a moment the mistress
and all the men-servants and maid-servants were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
at the door to greet us. It was at an hour in
the afternoon when the tea-house did not expect
guests. We took off our shoes and were led to
the floor above. There were four or five rooms
but they soon became one, the maids removing
the sliding screen panels, and we were given the
luxury of unpartitioned possession. One side,
entirely without wall, overhung the garden.</p>
<p>The maids brought cold water and tea and
sherbets and iced beer and fruits and cakes, and
there were dishes on the table of which we did
not even lift the covers. Then they knelt and
awaited our orders whether they should send for
<i lang="ja">geishas</i>. They explained that at that hour there
might be the rude annoyance to our honourable
patience of having to endure an unavoidable
delay. It would not be likely that the <i lang="ja">geishas</i>
could come immediately. We told them that our
honourable patience would suffer the delay.</p>
<p>When the French builders and decorators tried
to attain the ultimate for the housing of royalty
in the age of the Grand Monarch, their success
approached close to the realization of what the
imagination of the period asked. Versailles was
built with the idea of reaching theoretical perfection
through the completion of detail. The
imagination of the beholder was supposed to find<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
complete satisfaction in what he saw and not to
feel the urge of the possibility of still higher
flights. If the beholder was not content with
this “perfection,” he was indeed in a plight, for
there was no next step except to begin all over
again. The rhythm of the art of the Japanese
tea-house is not dependent upon regularity nor
balance. Its perfection can never be completed.
The last word cannot be spoken. It is like life.</p>
<p>We walked over the soft mats examining the
work of the craftsman builder who had made his
material yield its beauty through the grain and
line of each plank, board, beam, pillar, and panel.
I moved a cushion to the balcony and sat down
to study the room in deeper perspective. I never
followed out this sedate contemplation, for instead
I happened to look over the balcony. Across
the court of the garden I saw into an open room
of a wing. Three little girls, from about five
to seven years of age, were being trained in the
arts of the <i lang="ja">geisha</i>. At that moment their instruction
was in the dance.</p>
<p>The work was being gone through seriously but
the teachers were sympathetic and encouraging.
A dancing master assumed the general superintendence:
several older girls, full-fledged <i lang="ja">geishas</i>,
sat offering suggestions from their experience.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
They were in simple, everyday dress and not in
<i lang="ja">geisha</i> costume. The novitiates sometimes begin
their training even younger than five years.
Quite often such children are orphans who come
into the profession by legal adoption; others are
the children of parents who have apprenticed their
daughters under an arrangement which virtually
amounts to a sale. Naturally the <i lang="ja">geisha</i> master
does not select children who do not possess the
promise of grace, beauty, and charm. The long
training is expensive and it is intended that there
shall be a return on the investment. The little
girls, whom we could see, were practising over
and over again the steps of some classical dance
to the music of a <i lang="ja">samisen</i>. From the expression
of their faces to the position of their fingers in
carrying their fans, every possibility of technic
which should enter into the dance was receiving
the minutest attention.</p>
<p>For many years, Hori whispered, the training
of those little girls must go on to one end—to
interest, to entertain, and to amuse men. They
will be taught to wear the gorgeous silks and
embroideries of the <i lang="ja">geisha</i>; they will be taught
that every movement of the hand and arm in
pouring tea or passing the cup should be an art;
they will be taught when they should smile, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
they should laugh, and when they should sympathize;
they will be taught how to converse, how
to repeat the classical tales and the tales of folklore
and how deftly to introduce merry stories
of the day. After all this training the graduation
comes when they enter actively into the life
of the <i lang="ja">geisha</i>. In this budding a girl may amuse
partly by the mere gossamer fragility of her
youth, but later maturity brings the capital of
acquired experience, not only in the art of entertaining
but through having learned that the charm
of woman is largely the solace that she can bring
through sympathy and understanding.</p>
<p>What is the end? It may be better or worse,
tragic or domestic, marriage, shame, servitude,
modest anonymity, or the retirement to the teaching
of her art to another generation. Her life
is one obviously wherein the path has many by-ways
to temptation. There is much that must
be insincere and tinsel. If many a little heart,
sweet, modest, and unhardened, is crushed, nevertheless
if there be forgiving gods among those
to whom she prays, surely those gods must know
that these Mary Magdalenes are (so a poet of
the <i lang="ja">yoshiwara</i> wrote) in the greater truth as the
flowers of the lotus. Though their feet have
touched the black mud of the stagnant pond,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
“the heart of the <i lang="ja">geisha</i> is the flower of the
lotus.”</p>
<p>We heard a footstep at the door and turned
to see a <i lang="ja">geisha</i> standing there. She was tall and
slender. The delicate paleness of her face was
even whiter through fear. She saw us, barbarians,
sitting in the refinement of the tea-house
room. The carmine spots on her lips shone
brightly, giving to her expression the unreality
of the frightened look a doll might have if suddenly
brought to life. She was carrying a <i lang="ja">samisen</i>.
Her fingers tightly clutched the wrappings.
She came across the room toward us and as her
knees bent against the skirt of her <i lang="ja">kimono</i> I could
see that they were trembling. She sat down and
tried to smile. The duty of a <i lang="ja">geisha</i> is to smile.
She smiled with the same last effort of loyalty
which carries the soldier into a hopeless
charge.</p>
<p>I felt an abysmal brute to be there. Absurd
perhaps, but it was as if the command of some
strange, scornful, hitherto unheeded, almost unknown
spirit of justice was calling me to name
some defence why man in his arrogance has
assumed the right to pluck the beauty of the
flowers and has assumed the justification that the
reason for the perfume and the beauty is that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
they were created for him. It was a strange beginning
for the gaiety of a <i lang="ja">geisha</i> luncheon.</p>
<p>Tsuro-matsu drew back the fold of her sleeve
to her elbow and raised the teapot. The spout
trembled against the rim of the cup which she
was filling. She handed the cup to Hori and
until that moment I do not believe that she had
noticed that he was a Japanese.</p>
<p>“The child is frightened to death,” said
O-Owre-san. “Say something, Hori, quick! If
she wants to go home——”</p>
<p>Tsuro-matsu had read the meaning of the words
from their tone before Hori tried to translate.
She smiled and this time her lips parted from
her pretty teeth spontaneously. Then she said
that Hisu-matsu, a second <i lang="ja">geisha</i>, would soon
come. When the messenger had arrived for them
they had first to send for their hair dresser. The
messenger had told them that the guests at the
tea-house were foreigners. Thus her frightened
anticipation had had its beginning before she had
entered the room. We asked what had been her
fears.</p>
<p>Tsuro-matsu did not wish to say. She had
once before seen foreigners but only from her
balcony. We still persisted in our question.
When she realized that the truth would please<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
us more than compliments, even if the telling
somewhat offended against the etiquette of hospitality,
she ventured slowly to repeat some of
the tales which had been passed along by imaginative
tongues until they had eventually reached
the <i lang="ja">geisha</i> house of Kama-Suwa. We sat waiting
to hear some legend truly scandalous, but
there was nothing of such atrocity. She had not
heard of Buddhist children being stolen for sacrifice
on Christian altars. Our barbarities of the
Western world that worried the <i lang="ja">geisha</i> sensibility
were departures not from mercy but from manners.
We were wild and rough and of much
noise, always in a hurry, and knowing nothing
of the refinements, such as tea drinking, and we
were always to be discovered dropping rice grains
from our chopsticks onto the floor. And, as a
conclusion, the foreigner, such was her information,
had no appreciation for gentle conversation,
nor for any of the arts of social intercourse of
which the <i lang="ja">geisha</i>, in her vocation, is the guardian
priestess.</p>
<p>Of all the intricacies of thought in modern
Japan, the most interesting is the side-by-side
existence (without its possession seemingly arousing
any astonishment in the mind of the possessors)
of two completely different conceptions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of the foreigner. A Japanese may sometimes
sincerely render honour to a foreigner for superior
attainments and yet sustain the old feudal idea
that the foreigner must be a barbarian even in
those very attainments. It is quite possible when
the frightened Tsuro-matsu left the <i lang="ja">geisha</i> house
in her ’ricksha that she not only felt that she was
going to an ordeal where she would suffer from
the crudities of the <em>inferior</em> foreigner, but that
she was being singled out for the distinct honour
of entertaining the <em>superior</em> foreigner. In one
way, for the common people, this paradox may
be partially explained by the fact that their
leaders order them to honour the foreigner for
his practical achievements, and in their unhesitating
loyalty they do as they are told. It is
much easier to accept such authority than to
puzzle out how the knowledge and experience of
their worshipped ancestors could have been of
such superior brand and yet been of such ignorance.</p>
<p>Tsuro-matsu was telling us something of her
fears when Hisu-matsu entered. Upon what
scene she had expected to come, I have no imagining,
but her surprise at the state of intimate peace
which did reign proved that she had been thinking
of a different probability. Her surprise dissipated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
her timidity, and she began to laugh at
Tsuro-matsu’s earnestness. Hisu-matsu was somewhat
older. Her <i lang="ja">geisha</i> dress was perhaps richer;
quite likely her skill in conversation and in playing
the <i lang="ja">samisen</i> was superior—but she was not
so exquisitely fragile in her beauty.</p>
<p>Japan is the court of Haroun al-Raschid in
the love of hearing stories. Always we were
being asked for stories, stories of romance, love,
and adventure, “such as you tell at home when
sitting on the mats drinking tea.” Perhaps the
elevation to chairs has subtly sapped away from
us the art of tale spinning beyond the briefest
of anecdotes and jokes. There was no more of
a response in us when Tsuro-matsu asked us to
tell a story than there had been when Hori had
asked us to extemporize poetry in the valley of
the Kiso. We scored a failure as always but a
moment later chance gave us a second opportunity
for the vindication of Occidental accomplishments.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san had picked up a <i lang="ja">samisen</i> and was
searching for some harmonies in the long strings.
In the mystery of the night, coming out of the
darkness, the music of Japan has a certain functioning
charm harmonizing with the rhythm of
the wings of insects beating their way through
the shadows; but to hear the love song of a strident<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
cicada coming from the white throat and
red lips of a <i lang="ja">geisha</i>—at least that is not our
melody of passion. It was Hisu-matsu this time
who made the request. She asked O-Owre-san
to sing a song, “as you sing songs in America.”
This was the chance to redeem our failure. The
hills of Norway gave O-Owre-san a birth-gift of
melody. His whistling is like a bird call, clear
and true. Hori and I insisted that he must
whistle. It was the air of a folksong that he
remembered. It had the Viking cry of the Norse
wind and the lust of storm and battle. The two
girls tried to listen.</p>
<p>“Change to Pagliacci,” I whispered. The
music of the North had failed. I was in duress
to save our faces.</p>
<p>Again they tried to listen. Then they looked
at each other in astonishment and in each pair
of eyes there was annoyance. They began talking
to each other in disregard of Pagliacci and
everything Italian. It was an obvious disregard.
At first they had thought that he might be practising,
but when he continued the distressing
sounds, then they were sure that we were making
fun of their request. They were trying to save
their own faces. They had begun talking to
prove that they could not so easily be taken in.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Hori had the brilliancy to retreat. He hastened
to ask them to sing and play again. By sitting
raptly while the strings of the <i lang="ja">samisen</i> were rasped
by the sharp ivory pick and their voices followed
in accompaniment, we were able in a measure to
atone for the barbarity of our own music by showing
that we could listen appreciatively to good
music when opportunity granted.</p>
<p>The hour came to pay our reckoning and
to depart. We said good-bye over the teacups,
but when we were sitting at the door putting on
our shoes we heard the sound of the <i lang="ja">geishas’</i>
white <i lang="ja">tabi</i> on the stairs. Their two ’rickshas
wheeled up to the entrance for them, but they
hesitated. They stood whispering to each other
for a moment and then turned to us and suggested
that they would walk as far as our inn
gate with us if we wished. O-Owre-san and I
were nonplussed. Hori hurriedly told us that
their suggestion was a marked compliment, that
we should accept it with thanks, and that he
would explain later. Sometimes—and the occasions
are supposed to be so sufficiently rare as
to be of complimentary value—a popular <i lang="ja">geisha</i>
will drag the hem of her embroidered <i lang="ja">kimono</i>
along the street in this custom of courtesy by
which she shows her appreciation for her entertainment.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
It should be remembered that a <i lang="ja">geisha</i>
is traditionally a guest. In Tokyo, said Hori,
a young blood who has spent his last spendthrift
<i lang="ja">sen</i> on a gorgeous dinner will await such approval
as the hallmark upon his artistry as host. If it
is denied he reads in the answer not a mere feminine
caprice but an impartial, critical disapproval.
He seeks for the reason by trying to remember
any errors in his own hostly proficiency. It is
to be imagined, however, that while the bestowal
of this approval may theoretically only be employed
for the maintenance of the rigid standard
of etiquette and artistry, in practice it is not always
confined to such rarefied judgment.</p>
<p>The five of us started on the long walk to
the inn gate. I am afraid that the gentle <i lang="ja">geishas</i>
had not given thought to the composition of the
picture. Tsuro-matsu was rather tall for a Japanese,
but Hisu-matsu was not, and the <i lang="ja">seiyo-jins</i>
were somewhat over six feet each. In the daylight,
also, the <i lang="ja">geisha</i> costume noticeably brightens
a street. Walking abreast we made a cordon
stretching across the road to the utter bewilderment
of Kama-Suwa.</p>
<p>We had found before this that the crowds
which gather in provincial towns are seldom intentionally
annoying, although sometimes they do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
jam around a shop door, shutting off the light
and air. The steadfast staring may be unpleasant,
but the foreigner soon learns to think little
about naïve curiosity. Our march through Kama-Suwa
certainly did attract attention, but the
crowds separated and allowed us to pass without
following at our heels, and I believed Hori when
he said that this heroic restraint of curiosity arose
from their innate feeling that its manifestation
would be discourteous and inhospitable. This
sense of consideration was not a sufficiently quick
reaction, however, to prevent inordinate amazement
when anyone met us suddenly. A boy on
a bicycle, coming round a corner, forgot his own
personal existence entirely and his unguided wheel
carried him directly into a shop door, somewhat
to the disturbance of the ménage and himself.
Our progress continued slowly as the toed-in
sandals under the long <i lang="ja">kimono</i> skirts of the
<i lang="ja">geishas</i> did not take steps measuring with our
usual stride. We found that dictionary conversation
could not be pursued expeditiously in the
street, and after a few attempts to make known
words do the work of unknown with discouraging
results, the advance proceeded silently and rather
solemnly, although I received flashes from those
two demure maids that they had a sense of humour.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
The corners of their mouths did twitch
in mischievous enjoyment of the situation.</p>
<p>When we reached the shores of the lake we
sat down on the rocks and watched the boats.
The rising breeze roughened the surface into a
long path of flame against the red sun. Hisu-matsu
had been dissatisfied all afternoon with
the hurried effort of her hairdresser. She drew
out the large combs and the heavy strands of hair
fell over her shoulders. She told us a queer,
whimsical story about the birds that were flying
over the reeds. They said good-bye to us and
walked away and we turned in at our inn lane.</p>
<p>Our dinner was very late. Finally the stumbling
maid came, rubbing her eyes and yawning.
She was, as always we had seen her, on the immediate
point of going to sleep. She had been
carrying <i lang="ja">sake</i>, all the night before, but she had
been almost as sleepy on the previous day. Now,
in serving dinner, she went definitely to sleep
every time there was a lull in her duties. She
had one hiatus of lukewarm wakefulness in which
she mumbled some appeal to Hori, but he declared
to us that the words had no sense. We began
fearing for the few faculties she appeared to have.</p>
<p>Hori listened more carefully. “I believe she
is saying something,” he decided.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>
<p>Little by little we learned that she had a favour
to ask the foreign doctor. Just how she had discovered
that O-Owre-san had medical wisdom was
a mystery. She said that all Japan knows that
foreign doctors can do anything. She begged
for a drug to keep her awake, something that
she could swallow so that she would never feel
sleepy again, or better than that, some drug so
potent, if there were any such, that she would
never even have to sleep again.</p>
<p>“H’m,” said the foreign doctor. “Tell her
there isn’t any such drug. Tell her to get a good
night’s sleep. She will feel better about it in
the morning.”</p>
<p>Her disappointment was pitiful.</p>
<p>“But I shall never have a night’s sleep,” she
said. “If I ask for time to sleep I shall be
told that there are many maids who will be glad
to take my place.” She knew, she went on, that
she was very stupid, but she maintained that she
was not so stupid when she was not so sleepy.</p>
<p>It is outside our comprehension and experience
how the Chinese and Japanese can labour on and
on, more nearly attaining a wakeful condition
for the full round of the day than the individuals
of other races would consent to endure even if
they could continue life under the strain. In all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
inns the maids work long hours, nor do the mistresses
spare themselves. The mistress of the inn
at Kama-Suwa seemingly lacked the usual kindly
sympathy for her maids and was unusually demanding.
O-Hanna-san (the irony of calling
her a <em>flower</em>!) could not dare the risk of attempting
to escape from her slavery. It was for the
sake of her fatherless child that she dared not,
she told us. She, the clumsy, stumbling, stupid,
sleepy maid, had had her tragedy as had had the
pale, forsaken daughter of the nobility whom she
had waited upon the night before.</p>
<p>After her disappointment that she could obtain
from us no sleep-dispelling drug she toppled
again into unconsciousness. We could at least
give her temporary help. We sent for the mistress
and asked her for a full night’s sleep for
the girl. For the maid’s sake it was necessary
to put our demand on the ground that we must
have better service in the morning. This saved
the face of the mistress. After the mistress had
consented and had gone, poor O-Hanna-san’s
affectionate thanks were embarrassing.</p>
<p>On a point reaching into the lake and under
our balcony stood a small, one-storied shrine.
It was sheltered by a tiled roof pitched on four
columns. We saw from our room two figures<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
in white walking along the shore. They stopped
at the shrine and knelt for some time. When
they arose the bright moon suddenly revealed
that the two figures were Tsuro-matsu and Hisu-matsu.
Hori went down to speak to them and
in a moment their three heads appeared up the
stairs. The <i lang="ja">geishas</i> had changed the silks and
brocades of their costume for simple white <i lang="ja">kimonos</i>
and their hair was not now arranged after
the elaborate style of the professional hairdresser.
Instead of this simplicity detracting it quite
startlingly bespoke the charm of their delicate
beauty.</p>
<p>They were embarrassed and they were blushing.
It was one thing to have it their duty to
be whirled in ’rickshas to a tea-house to meet
strange patrons, but to pay an informal visit at
our rooms, especially at that hour, was quite another
affair, and most unconventional. They
were shocked at their own impulsiveness in having
run up the stairs and they were very much afraid
that someone in the inn would discover their
presence. The little shrine, it appeared, was in
especial favour with the members of the <i lang="ja">geisha</i>
house where they lived, and they often came,
particularly if the moon were shining in the early
evening, to worship before their duties called.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
We opened our rucksacks and found some odds
and ends which we made do for presents. They
chatted for a moment and then ran off into the
night.</p>
<p>Later Hori told me that as they were going
they had asked us to be their guests at the theatre—there
was a performance of one of the classic
dramas by a travelling troupe from Tokyo—and
afterwards to have supper at the tea-house.</p>
<p>Hori’s explanation of his refusal was rather
intricate and elaborate, but stripped of <i lang="ja">bushido</i> I
think the inner simplicity was that he had suffered
enough for one day from the conspicuous exhibition
of our long legs and he had no desire for
being responsible for taking them into a crowded
Japanese theatre.</p>

<h2>XIII<br>
<span class="titlefont">A LOG OF INCIDENTS</span></h2>
<p>It was dark and threatening the next morning
but we decided to be on our way. We bought
a couple of paper umbrellas. We soon found
that when we needed them at all that day we
needed a roof much more. Hori was off on his
bicycle and we arranged to overtake him at the
village of Fujimi. We were hardly out of Kama-Suwa
before we had to make our first dash for
shelter to escape drowning in the open road. The
thatched house which we besieged for shelter
would probably have been most picturesque on a
sunny day but it was exceedingly primitive for
a storm. Our hostess was a very old woman,
diminutive and smiling. The rain pounded
against her hut and discovered every possible
chance to force its way in. She tried to start
a fire from damp sticks and charcoal and succeeded
after a long effort. The fire was to heat
the water for our tea. It was useless to protest.
No guests might leave her house unhonoured by
a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Japan never seems so remote from the West
as when seen through the rain. Fishermen, in
straw raincoats, were wading in the creeks with
hand nets. The children in the villages were
wading in the gutters.</p>
<p>The towns seemed self-sufficient and prosperous.
They had captured the mountain streams
and had led them away from their channels to
run in deep, wide canals through the streets.
Innumerable waterwheels drew upon this energy
for the miniature factories. We were walking
through one of these towns—the sun was shining
brightly at the moment—when there was a
sprinkling of giant drops. We knew that that
meant another cloudburst and we turned in at
the first door. It was a barber’s shop. We
asked permission for standing room, but the men
who had been sitting around a large brazier lifted
it away and insisted upon giving us their places
on the matting.</p>
<p>The chairs, the mirrors, the shampoo bowls, the
razors, and all the rest of the elaborate paraphernalia
looked so immaculate and usable that I
expected O-Owre-san to decide that it would be
discourteous for him to waste such an opportunity
of having his beard trimmed. He surprised
me by suggesting that we toss up to see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
which one should make the experiment of the
complete surrender to all the inventions. Perhaps
he was tactfully suggesting that my unkemptness
showed the greater necessity, but the
turn of the coin made him the adventurer.</p>
<p>The rain was now falling so that it swept the
streets in a flood. The thunder was shaking the
hills. A thunderstorm, for me, is the most soporific
inducer in the world and my eyes began
to waver and soon I was many times asleep.
When I awoke, under O-Owre-san’s urge, the
sun was out again. My joints were stiff, I was
sleepy, and I was old, but the world seemed
very new after its scrubbing, and nothing less
than jauntiness could express the state of transformation,
brought about by clippers, shears, hot
towels, and everything that went with the treatment,
in the appearance of my companion. The
barber and his two assistants, with their huge
palm fans, were bowing and smiling with an air
of complete satisfaction. I was out of sympathy
both with refurnished nature and the revamped
man. I remarked irritably that his pursuit of
beauty would be the ruination of our joint purse.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said, “and the fees equalled the
bill. I had to pay some rent for your taking up
the entire floor for your siesta.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>
<p>The bill had been five <i lang="ja">sen</i> and the fees had
been five <i lang="ja">sen</i>, so that altogether we had squandered
five cents of our money.</p>
<p>Fujimi is little more than a hamlet. It is
tucked away in a fold of the hills off the main
paths of the trail. Its days are probably as ancient
as the worship of Fuji. The view of the
sacred mountain from Fujimi is a paradox of the
beautiful. The sudden sight of the blue outline
of the mountain against the sky comes crushingly
into one’s consciousness as an extraordinary
awakening and quickening, and yet the emotion
is deep, reverent, and silent. Maybe it was our
undue imagination but the peasants of the valley
seemed marked by quietude. While Fuji-yama
was cloud hidden that first day, on the long walk
of the next we found the lonely labourers of the
isolated farm terraces often staying their work
for a moment, their consciousness lost in passionate
gaze toward the sacred slope.</p>
<p>It was only by much questioning of the peasants
whom we met on the road that we were able
to find the hamlet. Once when we were unable
to understand the answer, with a quick smile to
disarm our protests, the questioned one turned
back his steps until he could point out the path.
We had been swinging along at our best pace in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the hours between torrents and it was not long
after mid-day when we found Hori’s bicycle outside
an inn. O-Owre-san declared that our sixteen
or so miles had not aroused him from the
sluggishness brought on by a full day’s rest at
Kama-Suwa and he was for going on, but as
the rain was now falling again, this time in a
settled drizzle, he had to be a martyr to enduring
a roof over his head or else to seek his own
drenching.</p>
<p>The inn was the most meagre in ordinary
equipment of any that we had found. It was
not much more than a rest-house, although it had
evidently at one time been of more pretence.
The fear expressed by our host that his house
was unworthy had the ardour of conviction. In
order to know better what to borrow from his
neighbours for the entertainment of the <i lang="ja">seiyo-jins</i>
he suggested a scale of three prices. We chose
the middle quotation of one <i lang="ja">yen</i>, twenty <i lang="ja">sen</i> (sixty
cents). The fire was then started in the kitchen.</p>
<p>Japanese architecture is said to be in direct
line of descent from the nomadic tent of Central
Asia. Just as the roof and the four corner posts
are the essentials of the tent, in the building of a
Japanese house, the corner posts are first set up
and the roof is built next. Our inn might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
served this theory of descent as an admirable
example. The roof was the chief reason for its
existence. There were no wings. The stairway
was on the outside, coming up through the balconies
which ran completely around the two upper
floors. In winter days when wooden shutters
enclose and darken the rooms the bare simplicity
may grow dreary. The wind is then the father
of shivering draughts which creep over the floor,
but for the days of summer, when the green valley
of Fujimi lies in the shelter of the great
granite ranges, the memory of the stifling cave-like
rooms of our Western architecture seemed
barbarous and of dull imagination in comparison.
The philosophy of Japan’s housebuilding appears
to be that it is better fully to live with nature
in nature’s season of wakefulness than to invent
a compromise shelter equally reserved against
nature through the revolution of the year.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san had gone exploring to find the
bath. A few minutes later our host excitedly came
up the stairs to warn us that the bearded foreigner
was tempting destruction. Rumour that foreigners
have experimented with cold baths and have
discovered reactions within themselves to endure
such rigour had not reached Fujimi. When the
impatient foreigner had learned that the hot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
bath was not ready, he filled the tub with the
icy water that came spouting through a bamboo
pipe. In the midst of our efforts to calm our
host, O-Owre-san, himself, appeared, red and
beaming. Nevertheless, neither his rosiness nor
his exhilaration could allure Hori and me into
following his recommendation to go and do likewise.
We decided, instead, to take the host’s
advice. He sent us to the public baths. Armed
with towels, and in borrowed <i lang="ja">kimonos</i> and borrowed
wooden <i lang="ja">geta</i>, we set forth. My <i lang="ja">kimono</i>
came to my knees, no lower, and it was restricted
in other dimensions. For the women and children
sitting in the doorways our progress through
the street may have brought some interest into a
rainy and perhaps otherwise dull afternoon.</p>
<p>The baths, housed in a low, small, ramshackle
building, were famous for leagues about. The
keeper of the baths was a “herbist.” He went
out into the mountains—on stealthy and secret
excursions which the cleverest tracker had never
followed—and brought back sweet-scented hay
which his wife sewed into bags and threw into
the hot water. Everything about the discovery,
she said, was their own secret. Whatever was the
secret of the herbs, the natural, delicate perfume
was pleasing. The two tubs for the men were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
fairly large tanks. They had been freshly filled
with heated spring water just before we entered.
It was not yet the men’s hour, but a half-dozen
women were in their half of the building, either
busily pouring water over themselves on the scrubbing
platform or sitting placidly up to their
chins in the hot water. The mistress was most
energetic. She had a pair of large scrubbing
brushes which she was applying to their backs.
Back scrubbing in Japan is an ancient institution
and the practice may have some real physiological
merit. At least the vigorous scrubbing up
and down the vertebrae produces a soothing and
restful reaction.</p>
<p>A phrase that I had come across in my dictionary
had stuck in my memory. Translated, it was:
“Will you kindly honour me by scrubbing my
back?” I asked Hori whether my remembrance
and pronunciation of the Japanese words were
correct.</p>
<p>“Pretty good,” said he, and then I saw a slumbering
twinkle in his black eyes. “But why do
you practise on me? Why don’t you say it to
the mistress to see whether she will understand?”</p>
<p>“Stop!” I spluttered. But it was too late.
He had called out to the busy mistress to ask
the foreigner to ask to have his back scrubbed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Until that moment we had been inconspicuous
in our dark end of the room, but now everybody
looked up and edged along for the entertainment
of hearing a foreigner speak Japanese. I was
responding, but my phrases were directed at Hori
and had nothing to do with back scrubbing.</p>
<p>There are exigencies of fate which come down
upon one like an avalanche. The revenue to the
busy mistress from the use of her scrubbing brush
was three <i lang="ja">sen</i> from each person, which was a full
<i lang="ja">sen</i> more than for the bath itself, and thus business
was business and a serious matter with her.
She descended upon me with her three-legged
stool and scrubbing brushes and proceeded to
earn the extra <i lang="ja">sen</i>. I was completely cowed by
her determination.</p>
<p>We sat parboiling ourselves in the tub for
some time. All the customers had now either
been scrubbed or had not asked to be scrubbed,
and the mistress could sit down for a moment to
rest and to talk. Particularly did she talk. She
talked on and on, exploiting the merits of the
local advantages of Fujimi. Ah, where could one
go to find Fujimi’s equal? Such views! And
we must promise to visit the tea-house. It was
unfair to refuse that to Fujimi. The maids, it
was true, were not <i lang="ja">geishas</i>, but they were every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
whit as talented as any <i lang="ja">geisha</i> of Tokyo, and sang
and played and danced far better than provincial
<i lang="ja">geishas</i>.</p>
<p>Back in our inn the extra twenty <i lang="ja">sen</i> apiece
above the minimum rate had wrought marvels
in the kitchen. We were hungry. We were
always hungry. And we had learned always to
expect the inn dinners to satisfy our demands.
That night we truly had marvellous dishes. The
bamboo shoots were as tender as bamboo shoots
can be. Whether supreme genius or chance was
responsible for the sauce for the chicken, the result
was perfection. Dinner was very early.
After the meal I found a longer <i lang="ja">kimono</i> and,
as the rain had stopped for an interval, Hori
and I walked to a hill to see the sunset. On our
way back we passed the tea-house which had
been so enthusiastically recommended by the mistress
of the baths. We went in. Green peaches
were brought to us to nibble at, and tea and warm
beer to sip.</p>
<p>The house was indeed gorgeous with its gold
screens and polished wood. The decorations almost
kept within traditional taste, and simplicity
had not been too grievously erred against; but
the atmosphere of proportion and rhythm had
been missed by that narrow margin which perversely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
is more irritating inversely to the width
of the escape. We may possibly have had the
added impulse to this critical judgment by the
insidious predilection of the mosquitoes for us
rather than for the two maids who were paring
the peaches. One of them explained that the
mosquitoes of Fujimi are famous for preferring
outsiders.</p>
<p>Two of the rooms were crowded with supper
parties, of wine, women, and song, but compared
to the revelries of bucolic bloods in other lands,
something might be said in praise of such restraint
as prevailed in the Fujimi tea-house. It
may be no honour nor compliment to the spirit
of refinement to wish vice as well as virtue clothed
in some modicum of grace and retirement, but
it does make the world easier to live in.</p>
<p>The soft rain stopped dripping from the eaves
some time in the night and the sky was clear
when the sun leaped above the mountain ridge,
as if impatient to find the radiance of the glorious,
virginal day. The green of the valley was a
glowing emerald and the mountains were sharp
and grey with no shielding haze.</p>
<p>Our host sent his daughter to lead us through
a short cut in the hills to the main road. Hori,
with his bicycle, had to take the conventional path.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
The little <i lang="ja">musume</i> trotted along at our side with
a full sense of responsibility, her feet twinkling
down the rocky pitches, her <i lang="ja">kimono</i> sleeves fluttering
out like wings. Suddenly she pointed the
way and then, before we could thank her, ran
back. Skipping and dancing she ran, reaching
out her hands to the leaves on the bushes or
waving them to the flying insects.</p>
<p>The rain clouds had hidden Fuji-san the day
before. On this morning as we came through the
sharp cut in the rocks which led to the main road,
outlined against the sky we saw the long purple
slope. We climbed to a terrace on the side of
a granite block and sat with our feet dangling
and our chins in our hands. There was one white
cloud, no bigger than a man’s hand. It floated
slowly toward the crater and then hesitated above
the snow ribs on the sides. Then came another
cloud across the sky, then another and another,
until the summit was hidden by the glowing veils.
We slid down from our rock and walked on toward
the mountain.</p>
<p>From the day that we left the plains and turned
into the hills our tramping had been long climbs
but now the road again dropped away toward the
lowlands. We had easily forgotten the hours of
dancing heat waves, but, with a start, I began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to remember Nagoya, of the rice plains, of those
stifling nights and brazen days. The memory
had also grown dim of my once rhapsodical joy
in finding shaved ice to slake my dusty thirst.
If I had never known anything but the quiet,
velvet smoothness of water from wells and springs
and the knowledge of the grind of ice particles
against my tongue had been denied me, then I
might well have mistaken affection for passion.
There was no spring nor stream to be found.
The lower path of the widening valley was growing
into a road but we were following a trail
higher up on the ridge. Down under the leaves
of the trees we thought we saw a thatched roof.
If there was a house there, there would be water.
We found a path downward by making it, and
we were rewarded by seeing a house under the
trees.</p>
<p>An old woman was reeling silk from the cocoons
which she had floating in a bowl of hot
water. She glanced up casually when she heard
our step, but when she saw what she saw her
mouth and eyes opened and the cocoons dropped
from her fingers. It was the purity of absolute
surprise without admixed fear or any other diluting
emotion. I began to doubt that she would ever
have another emotion but at last the need for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
breath racked her, and the resulting gasp freed
her from the spell of silence which, indeed, was
a most unusual state. She assailed us with a
deluge of questions. With every possible variation
of the query she demanded to know if we
were really foreigners. I was repeating, “<i lang="ja">Hei,
hei, seiyo-jin</i>” as best I could when I heard
coming through the valley the welcome rattle of
the demon bicycle.</p>
<p>I turned over my task to Hori and he took up
the assurance to the old woman that she was actually
in the presence of flesh and blood foreigners.
With his every reiteration the wider became the
smile of her satisfaction. She stood on one foot
and then the other and clapped her hands and
finally ran across the road to another house. She
called into the door and a young woman came out.
The girl was the wife of her grandson and the
explanations had to be made over again for her.
Then we sat down on the floor and she brought
tea and cold water and red peaches. The questions
still came. Our wrinkled hostess was a delighted
child. She stared at one of us and then
turned to stare at the other. At last she settled
a continuing gaze upon me. She was enduring
some restraint but it could be humanly endured
no longer. She walked over to me and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
naïvely unbuttoned the top buttons of my flannel
shirt.</p>
<p>“It is so,” she said to her granddaughter-in-law,
“they are white all over.”</p>
<p>When we got up to go I asked permission to
take her picture. We all stepped into the road
together. When the camera clicked and was again
in my rucksack, she dramatically raised her eyes
to the mountain tops and gave us her <i lang="la">vale</i>.</p>
<p>“I am eighty years old. I have never seen a
foreigner. I have wanted all my life to see a
foreigner. Now that I have seen foreigners I can
die happy.”</p>
<p>We gave her one of our paper umbrellas as a
remembrance so that if she should wake up the
next morning with a doubt that it had all really
happened there would be that visible evidence
standing in the corner. The testimony of our
visitation in the shape of a fifteen-cent umbrella
was evidently appreciated. She took it cherishingly
in her arms as if it were newborn and of
flickering life.</p>
<p>It is fourteen miles by railroad from Fujimi
to Hinoharu. The railroad would be the shortest
distance for a crow, but even that bird might
find himself the blacker if he should essay the
long, sooted tunnels. We found many extra miles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
by exploring the up-and-down paths for the
changing views of Fuji, but nevertheless it was
early in the afternoon when we reached Hinoharu.
I then discovered two shaved ice shops, one after
the other, and the intoxication pitched my mood
to full ebulliency. For one day O-Owre-san
could have as much walking as he could digest
as far as I was concerned. We shouldered our
rucksacks and Hori coasted off down the hill
with the promise of a welcome of shaved ice and
a hot bath at the best inn in Nirasaki.</p>
<p>Some distance out of Hinoharu and well into
the country we discovered two brothers of the
road. They were trying to manufacture a cup
out of a piece of bamboo to reach into the recesses
of the rocks to get at the water of a trickling
spring. We offered them the aid of our aluminum
cup. Japan may affirm, as she does, the non-existence
of any variety of native hobo, but I am
sure that either of our new friends would have answered
to the call of “Hello, Jack!” After salutations
and thanks were passed, O-Owre-san and I
climbed up the bank to the plot of grass in front
of a wayside temple and sat down for a contemplative
rest in the shade. We always tempted
calamity, it seemed, when we tried to rest under
the shadow of a temple. The two Jacks came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
tumbling after and shared our cigarettes with
Oriental appreciation. They were rather picturesque
individuals. Their cotton clothes were not
only in tatters but were imaginatively patched. In
a land where there is nudity and not nakedness
patches do seem an affectation of the imagination.</p>
<p>I was sleepy from the sun and I dropped back
in a natural couch between the roots of a tree
and pulled my cork helmet down over my face to
keep off the flies, leaving to O-Owre-san the study
of the habits and customs of the Nipponese tramp.
As I lay there in drowsy half-sleep one of those
companions, so I judged from the sounds which
crept under my hat into my ears, was suffering
from a mood of restlessness. Also he was afflicted
with a strange, gasping wheeze. I had just
reached the point of being interested enough to
look out from under my hat when a panting
breath was expulsed over my neck, and my hat
arose from no effort of mine. I was left lying
between the roots to look into a pair of pitiless,
yellow eyes.</p>
<p>It took me a frigid moment to discover that
my vis-à-vis was a horse. The animal stood over
me, holding my hat in his teeth just beyond any
sudden swing of my hand. After he had had
sufficiency of staring he tossed his head, still holding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
fast to the hat, and ambled off towards the
road. I jumped to my feet and followed. As
soon as the bony, ill-kempt creature stepped out
of the temple grounds his malevolence vanished.
He dropped the hat into the gutter and jogged
away to find a more conventional pasture. We
could now add animals to the list of uncanny
powers that from time to time had driven us from
resting in temple grounds. I had no temper left
for facing the laughter of the two Japanese
tramps. I called back to O-Owre-san that I was
on my way and he kindly brought my rucksack.</p>
<p>Instead of the usual sharp differentiation between
city and country, Nirasaki has an indefinite
beginning of straggling houses. The town
lies along the shore of the Kamanashigawa river,
which has cut its way through the granite rocks
of the valley, a strong current flowing a thick,
whitish grey colour. As we were entering the
outskirts we heard the shrill whistle of the reed
pipe of a pedlar and a moment later we saw him
coming out of a gate carrying his swinging
boxes of trays hung from a yoke across his shoulders.
He was so abnormally tall for a Japanese
that we quickened our step to have a look at him.
He dropped the reed from his lips to sing-song his
wares—odds and ends of shining trumpery. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
words were Japanese but the intoning called us
back to China, and when we saw his face we were
sure that he was a Manchu. He knew the last
ingratiating artifice that has ever been accredited
either to pedlar or Celestial. We delayed to appreciate
his technic, to see him approach the
women of the open-sided houses, and to fascinate
them by the intensity of his will to please, and
also by his ingratiating gallantry.</p>
<p>“Take care!” we felt like saying oracularly
to all Japan. “Take care that you never attempt
the conquest of China. China may be conquered
but never the Chinese. They will rise up and slay
you not by arms but by serving you better than
you can serve yourselves.”</p>
<p>We found Hori resting in an ice shop. He
had judged truly that the easiest way to find us
was to let us find him, trusting that as long as I
had a <i lang="ja">sen</i> I would never pass a <i lang="ja">kori</i> flag. The
very pretty maid had her <i lang="ja">kimono</i> sleeves tied
back from her graceful arms. I do not know what
story Kenjiro Hori had concocted to tell her but
after she had handed me my cupful of snow she
watched me steadily with the air that she expected
black magic at any moment. I caught a glimpse
of Hori’s twinkle. I was filled with suspicion.
Finally the maid turned upon Hori in exasperation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and said many things. Some strange tale
told about foreigners must have been one of Hori’s
best creations, but in some way we had failed to
live up to our heralding. She was exceedingly
pretty and a pretty girl in a pretty tempest is just
as interesting and bewitching in Nirasaki as in
any other spot in the world. However, any translation
of his tale to her Hori refused absolutely.</p>

<h2>XIV<br>
<span class="titlefont">CONCERNING INN MAIDS AND ALSO THE ELIXIR OF LIFE</span></h2>
<p>The native inn is such an interweaving of
privacy with no privacy at all that if the traveller
has a sympathetic liking for the hospitality it
should be put down to his temperament rather
than to his reasonableness or unreasonableness.
Calling upon all his reasonableness, the foreigner
may still be miserable amid Japanese customs if
he were born to a different crystallization. Hori
considered the inn at Nirasaki to be rather superior
to the average, meaning, I judged, not the
luxury of the furnishings so much as the excellence
of the service. The house was crowded.
At most of the country inns which we had so far
found we were the only guests, and the entire
family of the host had usually requisitioned itself
into service. Willingness and interest had made
up for the few lacks but this home-made machinery
might well have broken down if there had been
a sudden descent of other guests. At Nirasaki,
despite the crowding, we had not to wait an instant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
for the carrying out of any request. At all
times two maids were listening for our handclapping
and, for some of the time, three. They added
to the customary willingness the knowing how of
training. They were, in fact, trained inn <i lang="ja">ne-sans</i>,
a class whose manners and morals have been commented
upon with some frequency by casual travellers,
and it is possible that the outside world’s
popular judgment of Japanese women has sprung
largely from such observations.</p>
<p>In any argument about Japanese morals the
likelihood is that the simplest discussion will soon
march headlong into a controversy. There arises
in a critical comparison of their standards with
ours the temptation to assume as a basis our ideal
standard against their everyday practice.</p>
<p>The Japanese maid, the daughter of the common
people, has been again and again condemned
for the easy lightness of her regard for her virtue.
I have not found that foreigners who have
lived in Japan and who have known the people
intimately join their assent to this sweeping judgment.
This charge has grown out of a confusion
of possibility with fact. Although we consider
that our Western individualism allows far more
freedom of choice than does the Eastern family
social regulation, particularly in the rigid customs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
and traditions for women, nevertheless in the morality
of sex the guardianship of her chastity by an
unmarried Japanese woman of the lower classes is
a matter much more of her private concern and
nobody else’s business than social opinion deems
an advisable licence with us. But because the
Japanese woman has this freedom it is as absurd
to conclude that she makes but one choice as it
would be to believe that all order in our society is
maintained solely through the police and iron-clad
restrictions. When conduct shall be entirely determined
by rules, then it will be time to relegate
character to the museum.</p>
<p>The duties of the maids of an inn have never
included that she must be self-effaced and a silent
machine. In the historic friendly relationship
between maids and guests there exists a certain
standard of manners and good taste, a subtle necessity
to the continuance of such existence. One
cannot compare the customs of a Japanese inn
with the traditions existing in an Occidental hotel.
The <i lang="ja">ne-san</i> is unique. When simplicity and naïve
amusement are spontaneously natural, vulgarity
is starved.</p>
<p>After dinner the three maids brought a fresh
brewing of tea and teapots filled with iced water.
They also brought the message that a travelling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
theatrical troupe from Tokyo was giving both
new and classical plays at the Nirasaki theatre.
The actors and actresses were guests under our
roof and the mistress of the inn sent the suggestion
that the strollers would probably be pleased
to entertain us in our room with an act from one
of their plays and with dancing and music when
they returned at midnight. After our thirty miles
in the hot sun the hour of midnight sounded
grotesquely post-futuristic. However, it might
well have been possible, fortified by tea, iced
water, and tobacco, to have awaited the hour if
it had not been for another limit to our independence.
Temperamentally we might take little heed
of the morrow but we had also New England consciences
about paying our bills. We could not
invite the players to our room without inviting
them to a midnight supper, and we knew that
the joint treasury could not pay for such a supper.</p>
<p>Thus we made the excuse to the <i lang="ja">ne-sans</i> that
their laughter was more pleasing to us than the
sound of the <i lang="ja">samisen</i>. (This statement was not
without truth in itself.) The responsibility of
amusing us did not seem to weigh heavily upon
them; in fact it was we who appeared to be amusing
to them. Stupid creatures, we, who could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
even play the game of “Stone, Scissors, and Paper!”
Our Occidental wits were always a fraction
of a second behind. Hori laughed at the
bearded O-Owre-san until the toxic of the paroxysm
made him delirious. At last we acknowledged
the sheerness of our defeats at every venture by
sending the victors for ice cream and cakes, and
the evening ended with the solemn ceremonial of
trying to move the small tin spoons back and
forth between plate and lips quickly enough to
make a transfer of the frozen mounds before the
heat of the tropical night levelled them into
liquid.</p>
<p>To escape the mid-day sun in the short walk to
Kofu, we were off a little after sunrise. Kofu
is more than two thousand feet lower than Fujimi
and lies in the heart of a flat valley. It is an
ancient city and has not lost its ancient pride,
being the wealthy capital of the Kai province.
We had so much time for the walk that we delayed
continually, bargaining in little second-hand
shops where the entire stock could hardly have
been worth more than a <i lang="ja">yen</i>, and stopping at the
coolie tea places where labourers rested to smoke
and to mop their faces with pale blue towels.
When we were entering Kofu we were again
tempted to halt upon seeing a <i lang="ja">kori</i> flag floating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
in the air, proclaiming that an ice supply had arrived.
We had not expected to see Hori before
we should meet at the inn, but by chance he came
wheeling along our street. We called out and he
came into our shade. Listeners gathered around
our bench, apparently not so much interested in
seeing foreigners as in hearing a Japanese speak
English.</p>
<p>In the crowd was a very old man, so old that
his age seemed pathological rather than human.
He made progress by a slow pushing of his feet
through the dust. His red-rimmed, staring eyes
leered into ours as if we exerted a direct line
of magnetism. If we shifted our gaze he immediately
shifted around until he again came into
vision. Under his arm he carried a long glass
bottle, stoppered with a cloth-wound plug. He
held up the bottle before us. It was filled with a
dirty, pale yellow liquid. Pushed into the bottle
was a twisted root holding in the tangle of fibres
two or three stones furred with slime. The stones
looked somewhat like asbestos.</p>
<p>“What do you think it is?” he asked mysteriously.</p>
<p>We said that we had no idea.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t dare tell you the secret,” he went
on, “as the bottle is worth five hundred thousand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
<i lang="ja">yen</i>. If you should pay me a hundred <i lang="ja">yen</i> I
would not allow you one taste.”</p>
<p>We expressed our happiness that he should
have such a fortune. Then he asked if we were
Americans and, upon hearing that we were, he
formally inquired for an answer as to whether
the American nation would buy the bottle. “I
can tell you this much,” he concluded, “it contains
the elixir of eternal life.”</p>
<p>The ancient seemed to be such proof in himself
that he had lived forever that there was no arguing
about eternity with him. For the sake of
saying something Hori made the casual guess,
“Is it radium?” He was startled into palsy.
The crowd stared. Evidently they had heard of
radium and it meant magic. Alas! We had
gouged out the secret. “Ah-h-h!” said he, “since
you know so much, how can you resist the opportunity
of living forever?” We explained that
under the circumstances of our poverty it looked
as if we should have to die along with the rest of
the world.</p>
<p>“I have been but testing your faith and knowledge,”
he said. “The radium of the rocks is
permanent. Listen! The bottle may be filled
again and again without losing its strength. For
only thirty <i lang="ja">yen</i> you may drink.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>
<p>Forthwith he uncorked the bottle and there
escaped an odour so vile that if he had said the
tube was the sarcophagus of the lost egg of the
great auk we should have believed without dispute.
He poured a few drops into a glass and
said: “Drink, and you will live forever!”</p>
<p>It is not alone honour that may make one choose
death.</p>
<p>The crowd, however, sought eagerly for eternity.
They passed the glass around and touched
their tongues to the liquid. If any out of the
number of that circle escaped typhoid that fact
alone ought to convince them of their strength to
continue a long way on the road to eternity.</p>

<h2>XV<br>
<span class="titlefont">THE END OF THE TRAIL</span></h2>
<p>Whether or no the Bosen-ka inn of Kofu does
possess a wide reputation for comfort, it should
deservedly have it. O-Shio-san was the name of
the maid. This means O-Salt-san, but we renamed
her “O-Sato-san,” which means Miss
Sugar. She said that she had been at the inn
for fifteen years, but until the day before there
had never come a foreigner, and now there were
two besides ourselves. I do not understand how
such immunity could have been possible in a city
the size of Kofu. However, the fact that there
were Occidentals under the roof of the hostelry
at that moment was proved by sight and sound.
After the many days of hearing only the Japanese
cadence, the sound of Western tongues was almost
startling. The large room, which became
ours, was in the main building and faced the garden.
We could look across to the wing where
the two foreigners were sitting on their balcony.
They were eating tiffin and talking vigorously.
One was a short, black-haired, merry Frenchman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
the other a tall, blond, closely-cropped German.
They spoke either language as the words came.
Quite likely they had been in the same university
in some European city, and their travelling
was a leisurely grand tour. They could not have
been hurried or they would not have taken time
to search out Kofu. Their gay spirit was charming.
They looked into the eyes of the world with
a friendly gaze and the world smiled back at
them. Within the month, France and Germany
were to declare the implacable war.</p>
<p>High-pitched footbridges linked together the
miniature islands of the garden and carried a
labyrinthine path over the lotus-covered pond.
Lying on the cool, clean mats of our room, sheltered
from the sun, the thought of antique shops
lured me not. I declared for contemplation, but
Hori and O-Owre-san wandered forth. O-Shio-san
brought fresh tea and a brazier of glowing
charcoal for my pipe. My contemplation began
and ended with a luxurious enjoyment of the view
of the garden. Through the quiet air came the
slow, deep tones of temple gongs. It was a day
of special masses. My thoughts found rest in
sensuous nothingness and I drifted tranquilly in a
glory of inaction. Another day of such devotion
to passivity might have started the unfolding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
within me of the leaves of appreciation for the
philosophy of Nirvana, but in the morning some
illogical shame for such laziness urged me into
joining the pilgrimage of Hori and O-Owre-san
to the Sen-sho cañon.</p>

</div>
<p>The deep, sharp cleft in the granite through
which that mountain stream pitches has a rugged
beauty. Most perversely, if we had discovered
the grandeur for ourselves and had not been
over-persuaded by the innkeeper to take the long
walk, we would undoubtedly have been more enthusiastic,
but as it was we decided that we would
rather have spent the day wandering about in
Kofu. Even the unscalable cliffs took on sophistication
from the well-worn path below, which proclaimed
that the view had been the conventional
thing for centuries. Despite all the instruction
which the innkeeper had given us about distances
and direction, he had escaped correctness in every
detail. As often, there was no information obtainable
from the heavily-laden coolies tramping
along the way. If there is really any mystery
which separates East and West it is the East’s
oblivious indifference to time and space and our
complete inability to understand the working of
a mind which has over and over again been on a
journey and yet has never considered it sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
worth while to take cognizance either of
the distance or the hours.</p>
<p>As we were walking over the flat plain to the
beginning of the valley, we stopped for a few
minutes to watch a field drill of the conscript
army. It was a very hot day, but the uniforms
seemed designed for a Manchurian winter. A few
of the men had fallen out of the ranks from exhaustion.
We heard later that during that hot
week in one of the provinces some officer with a
new theory had issued an order against the drinking
of water during drill, and that the lives of a
number of soldiers had been sacrificed to sunstroke.
It stirred up an angry scandal. My
knowledge of positive thirst would have made me
a hanging judge if I had sat on the inquiring
court-martial.</p>
<p>We walked on and had forgotten the drill when
four or five men and a panting officer overtook
us. They entered into a sharp debate with Hori.
Finally they dropped behind but followed us until
we were a mile away. They had suspected that
we were Russian spies.</p>
<p>We lingered in Kofu for several days but at
last again took the old road which runs through
the long valleys to Tokyo. This trail from Kofu
on is rather closely followed by the railway just<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
as is the Tokaido in the South. I do not know
whether it was in honour of (or in disgust at)
all such modernities that feudal Yedo changed
its name to Tokyo. The capital was our destination
and we had intended keeping along the
direct road but upon a whim (and a look at the
map) we suddenly decided to climb the ridge
between us and Fuji-san, and then to encircle
the base of the sacred mountain until we should
find again the Tokaido which we had forsaken
at Nagoya.</p>
<p>It was at the moment of this decision that the
demon bicycle collapsed utterly. If it had acquiesced
to the change of route it would have had
to submit to being carried on the back of a coolie.
I have not dared to record all the subtle ingenuities
of that mechanical contrivance which it had
concocted from time to time to achieve its ends.
Its soul had been factoried under a star hostile
to human dignity. It could bring about a loss
of face to the most innocent who crossed its path.
It had the pride of never having been successfully
outwitted, and its soul was as proud as the soul
of Lucifer. It had no intention of submitting to
the indignity of being packed on a coolie nor to
have the world see it with its wheels wobbling
idly in the air. In desperate determination it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
committed <i lang="ja">hara-kiri</i>. Its suicide was heroically
completed. As I recorded in the chapter when
the bicycle was introduced, Hori gave a shining
piece of silver to the coolie to see that the remains
had suitable interment. Peace be to those twisted
spokes and to that jerry-contraptioned frame!</p>
<p>About noon we found a man with a horse.
The man hired himself out to run along behind
and Hori mounted the animal. The summit between
us and Fuji was only about three thousand
feet above our heads but as we continually had
to go down into deep valleys and come up again
our gross climbing took many steps. The
thatched villages were very primitive, and the
people were very nude. The homes which clung
desperately to the edges of the cliffs must have
had to breed a special race of children to survive
tumbles, just as in the villages underneath on
the shores of the small lakes, they must have
had to breed an instinctive knowledge of floating.
The houses of those peasants were as
much a part of nature as are birds’ nests, and
they so welded themselves into the unity of
the view from the ridges that we did not even
think to call them picturesque.</p>
<p>Poor Hori had not a moment when he could
sit perpendicularly on his steed. The road was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
either a scramble or a slide. Finally he dismissed
the coolies and the horse. We were at
the beginning of a path which was built in sharp
zigzags up the side of the mountain. A half-dozen
coolie girls with huge chests strapped on
their shoulders stopped at a spring and sat down
for a moment to fan their flushed, pretty faces.
They told us that this was the last climb but they
were indefinite about the remaining distance or
the time that it would take. It had been our
plan to get to the top in time for the sunset view
of Fuji and the lakes. Perhaps the demon bicycle
had been granted one last diabolical wish.
We were within a few feet of the summit, the
air was seemingly clear, when down came a thick,
wet cloud from nowhere at all, and our expectation
for the crowning glory of the day vanished.</p>
<p>All the way down the other side of the mountain
the fog hung over us but it lifted when
we reached the shore of Lake Shoji. A village
straggled along the water edge. We knew that
across the lake was a foreign hotel, but if we
had not known it we should nevertheless have had
some such suspicion. From the attitude of the
villagers it was evident that we had traversed
again into tourist territory. The mild, jocular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
incivility of the natives of any tourist resort any
place in the world, except when there is some
restraint under the immediacy of employment,
is innate and needs no aggravation for its flowering.
We were tourists, therefore we must be
imbecilic. Derisive hooting followed our ears
when we started walking around the lake instead
of conventionally taking a boat. Between the
fog on the mountain top and our reception in the
village we were somewhat out of sympathy with
the last hour of the day, and we were even less
happy when we reached the hotel, and it was
brought to our attention that we had failed to
remember that foreign prices prevail at foreign
hotels. True, there were excellent reasons why
the charges should be higher than at the native
inns. The foreign supplies had to be brought
long distances on coolie back. This knowledge,
however, did not increase the number of <i lang="ja">yen</i> in
our pockets. We were in a fitting mood for turning
away and pushing on to some isolated village.
Such a mood can drive a good bargain and the
end was that we were given a room with three
iron cots at a minimum charge. I must pay this
tribute to that iron cot: I relaxed on its springs
in an abandonment to sleep which I shall never
forget. But there were other things foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
which were not so pleasant. To have to wait
until eight o’clock for a formal dinner when we
were accustomed to having meals served at the
clapping of our hands, and to have to thump over
rough board floors after we had known the refinement
of soft matting, and to have to endure
all the other half-achieved attempts at foreign
service—well, “going native,” as the Britishers
say in final judgment, “had been the ruining of
us.”</p>
<p>Waiting until the late foreign breakfast hour
in the morning almost numbed the cheerfulness
that had risen in me from the exhilarating sleep
on the luxurious bed of springs, but the day was
shining in such perfection when we found an unfrequented
trail north of the chain of lakes, and
Fuji-san was resting so clearly in the crystal
air across the pine tree plain, that we quickly
dumped into a maw of forgetfulness any remembrance
of such mundane annoyances as foreign
hotels. It may have been that volcanic gases were
breaking through the clefts in the rocks and that
the fumes inspired us with a Delphic madness;
our mood became ecstatic. We unburdened ourselves
of wild and soaring theories of art and
religion, of love and life—and there were theories
that came forth which we had never dreamed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
existed in cosmos. We scattered these inspired
words in wanton waste as if we were on a journey
to some world where such wealth would be dross.</p>
<p>The town which we found for the night was
on what is called “the Shoji route around Fuji.”
We avoided the semi-foreign hotel but that did
not save us from being tourists. The native inn
had ready for us in the morning a bill almost twice
as large as it should have been. In consequence
we added no “tea-money.” If we had, we should
have gone from the village penniless. In all our
wandering this was the first deliberate overcharge,
and in one way it may have been justified in the
opinion of the mistress. She had probably learned
from the semi-foreign hotel across the street that
foreigners know not the custom of tea-money and
ignorantly pay only the bill that is presented without
adding a suitable and proportionate present.</p>
<p>Truly we were now in the domain not only of
the foreign tourist but of the native pilgrim as
well. All day we walked through the towns which
serve as starting points for the different routes of
ascent for Fuji. It was the height of the season
for the sacred climb and the towns, purveying
every imaginable necessity and souvenir, had
mushroomed into crowded camps. We were unworthy
guests. As far as our purchasing ability<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
was concerned, a postcard was an outside luxury.
When we reached Gotemba we sat down for a
conference, following the rule of “when in doubt
drink a pot of tea.”</p>
<p>By rail to Yokohama was fifty-one miles. We
had leisurely covered about twenty-five miles that
day. Even if we should make ten or fifteen miles
more before night, there would be a sufficiently
long, scorching, penniless day to come. The
country was not new to us as we had both tramped
through the exploited Miyanoshita and Kamakura
districts. “Since these things are so,” I made
argument, “let’s use our remaining coppers to buy
tickets on the express to Yokohama.” As no one’s
pride sufficiently demanded that we had to take
the fifty-one miles on foot, this plan was our final
agreement.</p>
<p>Our linen suits were perhaps not as freshly
laundered as those of the other haughty <i lang="ja">seiyo-jins</i>
who were riding on the first and second-class
cars of the train, but otherwise our poverty did
not particularly proclaim itself. We walked to
our hotel in Yokohama and took rooms, relying
that future funds would come out of the letter
which was supposedly waiting at the bank for me.
In the meantime in the bag which had been forwarded
from Nagoya I found a two-dollar American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
bill. This gift we cashed into <i lang="ja">yen</i> and sat
through the evening on a terrace over the bund
along the water front, sipping forgotten coffee
and ordering long, iced, fresh lemon drinks. A
steamer had landed that day and at the next table
to ours was a charming group of American girls.
They were filled with enthusiasm for the exotic.
The soft, evening air, the passing life along the
street, and the gay tables carried me back to my
own first night in Japan, which had been spent
eleven years before on that very terrace.</p>
<p>The hoped-for letter was waiting for me at the
bank. The amount above the exact sum necessary
for my steamship ticket had been intended for insurance
against extras. It was now necessary
for mere existence. We entered into an infinite
calculation of finance down to the ultimate <i lang="ja">sen</i>.
Yokohama was no place for economy and we
shook off its dust for that of Tokyo and were
happy again in a native inn. With our linen suits
laundered, we called on old friends and shopped
betimes on credit. It was a rather queer sensation
to be bargaining for luxuries when a mere
<i lang="la">bona fide</i> payment of a ’ricksha charge meant a
most delicate readjustment of our entire capital.
Dealers were quite willing to forward boxes to
America with hardly more guarantee than our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
promise to pay sometime. I felt that if we were
to ask them suddenly for ten <i lang="ja">yen</i> in cash our
credit would have crashed to earth. Nevertheless
we were confident of our dole outlasting our needs.
We lived our moments gaily. We saved <i lang="ja">yen</i> to
pay the inn bill, and our boat was scheduled to
sail on a certain day.</p>
<p>Hori was determined that our last day should
be worthy and memorable. Through friends he
arranged that we should meet Count Okuma, the
Premier of the Empire. We had made most of
our visits about the city on foot, and on one of
the hottest days we had walked the round trip of
a dozen miles to have afternoon tea with a former
Japanese diplomat to America and his family,
trusting that his sense of humour would forgive
our perspiration, but one does not arrive thus at
a palace door. Great was the excitement at the
inn when ’ricksha men were called and our destination
was given out. We dashed away and
careened around the corners at tremendous speed.
It was at least the second hottest day of the year,
but the coolies realized that they were part of a
ceremony and that their duty was to arrive streaming,
panting, and exhausted.</p>
<p>Count Okuma, on his son’s arm, entered the
small reception room into which we were shown.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
(The bullet of a fanatic shattered the bone of his
leg when he was a young man.) Count Okuma
is almost the last survivor of that group who
directed the miracle of transforming the Japan
of feudalism into the modern nation.</p>
<p>We drank tea and asked formal questions. Following
some turn of the conversation—Count
Okuma was speaking of loyalty—we inquired, as
we had of the ancient schoolmaster of Kama-Suwa:
“Can virtue be taught?”</p>
<p>The expression in the eyes of the Premier’s
great, handsome head had been passive as he
had acquiesced in what had been said up to that
time. Now his expression became positive. He
spoke slowly as if he were summing up the belief
and experience of a lifetime.</p>
<p>“When Japan, after her centuries of hermitage,
had suddenly either to face the West and to compete
successfully with you, or to sink into being a
tributary and exploited people, our greatest necessity
in patriotism was to recognize instantly that
in the physical and material world we had to learn
everything from you. Our social, commercial, and
governmental methods were suited only to the organization
of society which we then had. We
discovered that your world is a world of commerce
and competition; that the achieving of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
wealth from the profits of trade demands training,
efficiency, ingenuity, and initiative. Our
civilization had not developed these qualities in
us. We could only hope that we had latent ability.
Furthermore, observation of you taught us
to realize the value of physical power. We saw
that mere superior cleverness and ability in the
competition to live is not sufficient until backed
by a preparedness of force. America was our
great teacher and we shall never cease to be
grateful. In the physical world we had everything
to learn from you, and to-day we must constantly
remember that we have only begun to
learn.</p>
<p>“It was our overwhelming task to begin at the
beginning, and we should have had no success if it
had not been for the moral qualities of the Japanese
people. These virtues cannot be taught—merely
as they are required. They are the spiritual
and moral inheritage from the past. In the
avalanche of Western ideas which came upon us, it
was our great work to pick, to choose, and to
adapt. These ideas were the ideas of the commercial
world. There are those who say that
Japan in taking over these standards of materialism
relinquished the priceless inheritance of its
own spiritual life. No! We have had <em>everything</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
to learn from you in methods, but that
should not be confused with spiritual values. I
do not mean mere creeds and dogma, but to the
essence, the great fundamentals of all true religion.</p>
<p>“It is possible that sometime in the future the
outside world may discover that it will have need
to come to us for the values that are ours through
our great moral inheritance of loyalty. In a material
way we can never pay back to you our
obligation for having been taught your material
lessons. But it may be that Western nations
have put too great faith in materialism and that
they will arrive at the bitter knowledge that the
fruit of life is death unless the faith of men
reaches out for something beyond the material.
Then, if we of Japan have humbly guarded our
spiritual wealth, the world may come to ask the
secret of our spiritual values as we went to you
to ask the inner secret of your material values.”</p>

<h2>XVI<br>
<span class="titlefont">BEACH COMBERS</span></h2>
<p>On the morning that the boat was to sail from
Yokohama we were up as soon as the sun first
came through the bamboo shades. We exchanged
presents with everyone in the inn and then walked
away to the station, and everyone from the aristocratic
mistress to the messenger boy stood waving
to us as long as we could turn back to see
them. Our packages and presents half filled the
car. Hori had had a telegram to hurry home.
The train was a through express to Kyoto and
we said “<i lang="ja">sayonara</i>” to him from the Yokohama
platform.</p>
<p>We went to the bank and I exchanged my receipt
for the envelope which held the money for
my steamer ticket. In our treasury was left one
last Japanese note which we had been saving as
a margin. We now thought it was safely ours to
spend as we might choose. We went to find some
very particular incense and some very particular
tea which a Japanese acquaintance had discovered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and had given us the address of. We plunged
almost to the limit of the note.</p>
<p>“Haven’t you heard that your boat has been
held up forty-eight hours in Kobe?” asked the
steamship agent.</p>
<p>We had heard no such news, but we were interested.
To be able to have, when one might wish
to make the choice, the gift of forty-eight hours
in Japan would be one sort of a blessing. At
that particular moment the prospect had complications.
Until that instant our system of finance
had been the pride of our hearts. We had calculated
so admirably that we had retained just
one <i lang="ja">yen</i> for porters’ fees at the dock.</p>
<p>O-Owre-san had his return ticket. “Can’t I
pay for my ticket in part by cheque?” I asked.</p>
<p>After consultation in the inner office the agent
returned and announced, “No, that isn’t done.”</p>
<p>The agent and his advisers thought that if I
should happen to fall overboard there might be a
legal complication with my estate—if I happened
to have an estate.</p>
<p>“Your records show,” I argued, “that my
friend has crossed on your line three times. Discounting
any other substantiality, at least that
proves that one of us has had practice in not tumbling
overside.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>
<p>Evidently my logic was at fault. From the
dubious looks that came across the desk I judged
that the agent was thinking that such fly-like
pertinacity of sticking aboard a vessel was suspicious
and unnatural in a passenger.</p>
<p>“Well,” said O-Owre-san as we walked away,
“you’ve wondered what it would be like to be
an amateur beach comber. Now is your admirable
chance.”</p>
<p>O-Owre-san seemed to forget that he was in
no better position than was I in regard to
funds.</p>
<p>The day before we had had tea with the
Premier of Japan. Now we faced forty-eight
hours of starvation. Our horoscopes evidently
had been cast that we were to be beach combers,
the admirable chance of which O-Owre-san had
suggested.</p>
<p>We did not deceive ourselves that our few hours
of homelessness made us professionals, nevertheless
we were given a picture impression of Yokohama
that could only have been bought by hunger
and sleeplessness. We saw the going to bed of the
city, and we saw its getting up. We saw Theatre
Street gay with lanterns and filled with merrymakers.
Hours later we saw the lanterns go out
and the waiters and waitresses come forth to crowd<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
into the public baths. We walked through the
glitter of the street which winds between the
houses of the wall-imprisoned <i lang="ja">Yoshiwara</i> district.
There is but one entrance to this district—a long
stone bridge. We saw that bridge again, at the
hour of sunrise. It was then crowded with beggars
and loathsome hangers-on, waiting to importune
the exodus. Vice by grey daylight is horrible,
and those brilliant palaces of the night before
bulked in a row of dull and sinister ugliness
in the half daylight. Back and forth we explored
the streets of the city. We passed a foreign
sailors’ low dive, and a toothless old woman
and a leering youth grabbed at our arms and
invited us in. They spoke phrases of English.
There was wild laughter and music on the upper
floor.</p>
<p>Sometimes the hours went quickly, sometimes
they lingered interminably with no seeming relation
between their speeding and the interest of
the moment. Sometimes we were hungry and
sometimes we forgot our hunger. We found a
small park near the foreign settlement with
benches admirable for sleeping if it had not been
for the diligence of the sand fleas and the gnats.
From the park we walked down along the bund
and on the promenade facing the harbour we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
found two seats. A Japanese sailor was sitting
on one.</p>
<p>We wished him good-evening and shared with
him our cigarettes. After a time we wandered
away to walk again through the streets of the
bright lanterns. We had been refusing ’ricksha
men for so many hours that the guild at last
seemed to remember us as non-possibilities, that
is, all except one man who persisted in turning
up at every corner. He spoke some English and
had a new suggestion for his every proposal. If
ever a coolie looked theatrically villainous, it was
that coolie; and furthermore, he was half-drunk
from cheap <i lang="ja">sake</i>. Eventually he discovered a
companion and the two of them settled down at
our heels. Whenever we hesitated they threw
their ’ricksha shafts across our path. They
thought that we were officers from some ship and
they were counting upon our having to return
before the four-o’clock watch. I do not know that
officers ever do have to return at that hour, but
the coolies were sure that we had such necessity.
When four o’clock came they were mystified and
angry. Until then they had rather amused us.
We now told them to be off and we walked away
into the quiet streets. They still persisted in their
following. We tried indifference and we tried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
invective. I could see that the police at the corners
were watching the procession. We might
have appealed to them, but one seldom appeals to
the police in a foreign land, especially in Japan,
if there is any question of time to be considered.
We had to take the boat the next morning. We
had no desire to be ordered to report the next day
at a police station; and for the matter of that, I
should hardly have felt like criticizing any officer
for deciding to lock us all up together. The coolies
might have appealed that we had hired them
and had not paid them. Anyhow, why should
two foreigners be wandering around in questionable
districts at such an hour of the night? If
there had to be a settlement with our pair of villains,
it was just as well to have it beyond the
eye of the law.</p>
<p>Our next move was melodramatic. We drew a
line across the road and when our parasites
caught up we told them that they crossed that line
at their peril. Just what we should have done if
they had crossed the line I have no idea. We
walked along pleased with the result of our ultimatum
until, ten or fifteen minutes later, I happened
to turn around and again saw the two men,
this time without their ’rickshas.</p>
<p>We were now headed toward the sea front by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
way of the foreign sections. The buildings were
absolutely dark but there was an occasional street
light. If there were any watchmen they were
within the walls. We had walked through the
narrow streets of that district so often that we
remembered the turns. We felt sure that the men
could not catch up with us except from behind.
We were well out on the bund before they came
out of the alley that we had left. They were both
carrying sticks, which looked like ’ricksha shafts,
and the second man had a knife.</p>
<p>We walked along toward the benches where we
had been sitting earlier in the night. Steamer
lights were twinkling on the harbour and O-Owre-san
pointed out our ship waiting to dock at sunrise.
Years before I had been attacked in the
streets of San Francisco, but that assault had
been so sudden that there was no anticipatory excitement.
Our Yokohama anticipatory reflection
was the amusing idea that if the knaves should attain
the triumph of searching our pockets they
would have a most disheartening anti-climax
after all their evening’s trouble.</p>
<p>Just as we reached the benches they came for
us. We stepped around the first bench to break
the charge. Outstretched on the bench was our
Japanese sailor whom we had helped out with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
cigarettes. He may have been asleep, but when
he jumped to his feet he was very wide awake.
Without waiting for particulars he whipped out
a clasp knife. We had been friends and this was
a chance to even up his obligation to us. The
two coolies stopped as if they had run against an
invisible wire. We stood facing each other, and
then, as stealthily as a great cat, the sailor began
moving forward. He walked very slowly but he
seemed to thirst to use his knife. Even with three
to two, I felt that the coolies, half-drunken, would
have tried to hold their ground if it had not been
for the sailor’s uncanny deliberation. They waited
for him to come no nearer. They fled. We
could hear them running long after the darkness
closed them in.</p>
<p>We tried to express our appreciation to the
sailor for his interest. He made some answer
which sounded as if he were bored.</p>
<p>One place and another we had found a little
sleep in the two days but the thought of a soft,
clean steamer bunk began to form itself in my
brain and the first sign of the sun was truly welcome.
We turned back to the city for one last
long walk over the heights. The town was sleepily
waking up. The streets that had been the darkest
in the night were now the busiest. Our walk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
ended at the parcel room of the railway station
where we had left our rucksacks. The boy who
was sweeping out the station restaurant allowed
us to shave and scrub behind a screen and
make ourselves somewhat presentable for the
boat.</p>
<p>Our luggage, which had been in storage, was on
the dock waiting for us. O-Owre-san thoroughly
shook the linen envelope which had so long been
our treasury but the yield refused to increase
beyond three silver ten-<i lang="ja">sen</i> pieces. I once saw an
Italian in Venice fee an entire hotel line with a
few coppers. He accomplished the act with such
graceful courtesy that seemingly the servitors
were appreciative of the spirit of the giving rather
than the value of the coins. I tried to distribute
our pieces of silver to the porters on the dock
with an air copied from my remembrance of the
Italian, and the Nipponese recipients entered into
the drama with sufficient make-belief to have saved
our faces if it had not been for the chill in the
critical eyes of two English sailors standing at the
gangplank. The implication of their Anglo-Saxon
hauteur was that it might be satisfying to
the heathen in their darkness to weigh in with the
heft of compensation such useless freight as
palaver and smiles, but as for them, they belonged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
to a civilization preferring less manners and more
substance.</p>
<p>As the boat swung from the pier and open
water began to show, a man came running down
the dock waving the copy of a cablegram. “Germany
has invaded France and England may declare
war,” he shouted. Yes, decidedly our days of
turning back the clock were over. We were no
longer <i lang="ja">ronins</i> wandering in feudal Japan. We
had left the Two-Sworded Trails and were back in
the civilization of the two English sailors.</p>
<p>Slowly the harbour of Yokohama was curtained
and disappeared behind a brightly glistening mist.
I stood against the rail trying to think of America
and Europe. My mind had that illusory, abnormal
clearness which sometimes follows days without
sleep. I stood, thinking, thinking, the first
beginning of that agony of trying to add a cubit
to our vision by thought.</p>

law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

</div><div>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div><div>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div><blockquote><div>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div><div>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div><div>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

    <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    </li>
    <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    </li>
    <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </li>
    <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div><div>
1.F.
</div><div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div><div>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div><div>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div><div>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

</div><div>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div><div>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div><div class="secthead">
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div><div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div><div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div><div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div><div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div><div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div><div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div><div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div><div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
